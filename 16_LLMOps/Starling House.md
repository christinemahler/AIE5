## Character Analysis: Opal and Arthur Starling

**Opal and Arthur Starling represent complex characters that subvert traditional Gothic tropes.** Opal, a 26-year-old woman, embodies resilience and independence, driven by her desire to protect her younger brother, Jasper. Her upbringing in a transient lifestyle, marked by her birth in a car, fosters a sense of alienation from her hometown of Eden, Kentucky. Opal's fierce independence is evident in her refusal to seek help, stating, “I work for what I can and steal the rest; I don’t owe anybody shit.” This mindset isolates her, as she overlooks the support from others in her community.

Arthur, the 28-year-old Warden of Starling House, grapples with the weight of his family's legacy. His character arc reveals a struggle between duty and personal desire, as he seeks to break the cycle of violence associated with his family's past. Unlike typical Gothic heroes, Arthur's vulnerability and need for connection emerge through his relationship with Opal, challenging the archetype of the brooding, solitary figure.

Together, Opal and Arthur navigate the haunting legacy of Starling House, confronting their fears and the dark history that binds them.
