		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to leverage NICHD clinical research network infrastructure relevant to infants, children, women, pregnant and lactating individuals, and persons with disabilities to conduct innovative, multisite, investigator-initiated clinical trials and observational studies. This NOFO will utilize a bi-phasic (UG3/UH3), milestone-driven mechanism consisting of a start-up phase (UG3) and a full enrollment and clinical study implementation phase (UH3). Applications submitted in response to this NOFO must address specific aims and milestones for both the UG3 and UH3 phases. A UG3 project (phase I) that meets its milestones will be administratively considered by NICHD and prioritized for transition to the UH3 award (phase II). This NOFO provides an opportunity to leverage NICHD clinical research network infrastructure as a platform for investigator-initiated innovative hypotheses by <i>any </i>investigator in the extramural community. Applications must be submitted as investigator-initiated, multi-Project Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) grant applications in conjunction with the respective NICHD-supported Network Data Coordinating Center (DCC), or equivalent as determined by the NICHD.&nbsp;</p>

		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>To conduct and support laboratory research, clinical trials, and studies with people that explore health processes. NICHD researchers examine growth and development, biologic and reproductive functions, behavior patterns, and population dynamics to protect and maintain the health of all people. To examine the impact of disabilities, diseases, and defects on the lives of individuals. With this information, the NICHD hopes to restore, increase, and maximize the capabilities of people affected by disease and injury. To sponsor training programs for scientists, doctors, and researchers to ensure that NICHD research can continue. By training these professionals in the latest research methods and technologies, the NICHD will be able to conduct its research and make health research progress until all children, adults, families, and populations enjoy good health. NICHD&#146;s mission is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220473' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><strong>Purpose / Research Objectives</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to leverage NICHD clinical research network infrastructure relevant to infants, children, women, pregnant and lactating individuals, and persons with disabilities to conduct innovative, multisite, investigator-initiated clinical trials and observational studies. This NOFO will utilize a bi-phasic (UG3/UH3), milestone-driven mechanism consisting of a start-up phase of up to two years (UG3) and a full enrollment and clinical study implementation phase (UH3) up to a <i>total </i>of seven years. Applications submitted in response to this NOFO must address specific aims and milestones for both the UG3 and UH3 phases. A UG3 project (phase I) that meets its milestones will be administratively considered by NICHD and prioritized for transition to the UH3 award (phase II). This NOFO provides an opportunity to leverage NICHD clinical research Network infrastructure as a platform for investigator-initiated innovative hypotheses by <i>any </i>investigator in the extramural community. Applications must be submitted as investigator-initiated, multi-Project Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) grant applications in conjunction with the respective NICHD-supported Network Data Coordinating Center (DCC).</p><p>The NICHD has a long tradition of supporting multisite clinical research dating back to the mid-1980s. Since that time, the NICHD has continued to expand its infrastructure support of multisite clinical research by establishing additional Clinical Research Networks to address other areas of science relevant to its mission. Beginning in 2016, the NIH proposed, and subsequently implemented a series of reforms to enhance clinical trial stewardship and transparency, and thereby, further assure the success of the NIH clinical trial enterprise. As part of that initiative, individual NIH Institutes and Centers were asked to develop their own clinical trial funding opportunities to address their research priorities and strategic goals. In response, the NICHD re-affirmed its commitment to conducting rigorous multisite clinical trials and identified&nbsp;four guiding principles for such research delineated in <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HD-19-034.html">NOT-HD-19-034</a>: <i>Infrastructure for NICHD Multisite Clinical Trials.</i></p><p>To operationalize those four guiding principles and avail this multisite clinical research infrastructure to a more diverse and wider range of investigators, NICHD published <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-037.html">PAR-23-037</a> in November 2022. The cooperative (U01) mechanism provided an opportunity for non-Network investigators to work collaboratively with Network investigators to propose research projects to be conducted by and within participating NICHD-supported Clinical Research Networks. All applications submitted in response to <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-037.html">PAR-23-037</a> first underwent a rigorous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/clinical-research/clinical-trial-preapplication-process">pre-application&nbsp;process</a> to assess the scientific scope and overall feasibility of proposed projects incorporating the collective and collaborative input from the respective and applicable NICHD Network component(s) as well as from the NICHD during its pre-application review. Concept proposals approved via this pre-application process were developed by investigators into U01 applications and submitted via <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-037.html">PAR-23-037</a> as investigator-initiated, multi-PD/PI grant applications with the respective DCC designated as the Contact PD/PI. Applications submitted in response to the funding announcement were reviewed by a NICHD-convened scientific peer review panel. This NOFO replaces that initial funding announcement (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-037.html">PAR-23-037</a>) and incorporates feedback received during the first two years of operationalizing the four guiding principles described in NOT-HD-19-034.</p><p><strong>Specific Areas of Research Interest</strong></p><p>This NOFO continues to invite applications for multisite biomedical clinical trials and observational studies developed in conjunction with NICHD Networks that will be conducted using NICHD-supported Network infrastructure.&nbsp;The scientific scope of this funding opportunity is focused on specific areas of the NICHD mission and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/strategicplan">Strategic Plan</a>, and the corresponding Networks (listed below) that support those areas of study. Although multisite pilot trials and observational studies will be considered responsive, preference will be given to large scale clinical trials.</p><p>This NOFO utilizes a bi-phasic (UG3/UH3), milestone-driven mechanism consisting of a start-up phase of up to two years (UG3) and a full enrollment and clinical study implementation phase (UH3) of up to a <i>total</i> of seven years for both phases. The implementation of a phased grant mechanism approach to funding is a key component of this new funding opportunity. A phased mechanism facilitates greater stewardship of clinical trials and observational studies and this NOFO aims to further the modernization of clinical research by supporting innovative projects that are flexible, cost-effective, incorporated into clinical care and of higher impact. Applications submitted to this NOFO should hold the potential to advance patient care, inform treatment guidelines, and/or provide new US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications and labeling for biomedical interventions by leveraging NICHD Clinical Research Network infrastructure relevant to infants, children, women, pregnant and lactating individuals, and persons with disabilities.</p><p>Applications submitted in response to this NOFO must address topics that align with one or more of the participating Networks and their corresponding scientific areas of interest. <strong>Strong preference will be given to studies that:</strong></p><ul><li>Optimize diverse participant enrollment representative of the condition being studied</li><li>Utilize innovative study designs to facilitate timely and informed study completion, including but not limited to, complex adaptive designs, embedded pragmatic trials, Bayesian statistical analyses, enriched enrollment,&nbsp;machine learning approaches, real-world data use and/or innovative follow-up methodologies</li><li>Align with clinical practice and can be integrated into real-world clinical care in a timely manner</li><li>Leverage electronic health records and other digital data for data collection</li><li>Encourage and facilitate participation of junior investigators (e.g., Fellows, Assistant Professors, and NIH-defined early-stage investigators) of diverse backgrounds.</li></ul><p>Applications submitted in response to this NOFO should address topics that align with one or more of the following Networks and their corresponding science:</p><p><a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/cpccrn"><i>Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network</i></a><i>&nbsp;(CPCCRN)</i></p><p>The purpose of the CPCCRN is to investigate the efficacy of treatment and management strategies to care for critically ill and injured children, as well as to better understand the pathophysiological basis of critical illness and injury in childhood. Given the relatively small and widely heterogeneous pediatric critically ill and injured patient population, the vigorous use of appropriate scientific methodologies deployed across a network of sites will achieve the numbers of patients required to provide robust clinical answers more rapidly than any individual clinical site acting alone. The CPCCRN, consisting of 12 Clinical Sites and 12 ancillary sites with over 61,000 annual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admissions, maintains the infrastructure&nbsp;needed to conduct definitive, rigorous, and reproducible multisite research to enhance the understanding of critical illness in children, to advance the care of critically ill and injured children, and to improve outcomes for this most vulnerable population.&nbsp;NICHD expects the CPCCRN to be its primary and first-line infrastructure involved in implementing multisite pediatric critical care clinical research and trials. The Request For Applications (RFA) for the current cycle of the CPPCRN was&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-21-016.html">RFA-HD-21-016</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/globalnetwork"><i>Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research</i></a><i><u> (GN)</u></i></p><p>The purpose of the Global Network for Women&#146;s and Children&#146;s Health Research is to improve health outcomes for women and children in low- and lower middle-income countries by researching sustainable, cost-effective health interventions, and strengthening research infrastructure and public health intervention capabilities in developing countries. The objective is&nbsp;to improve maternal and child survival, focusing on high-need areas, such as preventing life-threatening obstetric complications, improving infant birth weight and nutrition, and reducing prematurity and complications from preterm delivery in rural and peri-urban communities.&nbsp;The Network will increase opportunities for scientific linkages, interaction, knowledge development and transfer, and collaborative partnerships among US and foreign investigators and institutions. The current GN includes seven international sites in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, India, Pakistan, and Zambia, with partner institutions in the United States. Scientists in these countries work with their peer and partner institutions in the United States to conduct clinical trials in these low-resource areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;RFAs for the current GN cycle were&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-23-008.html">RFA-HD-23-008</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-23-009.html">RFA-HD-23-009</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/mfmu"><i>Maternal-Fetal Medicine</i></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/mfmu"><i>Units (MFMU) Network</i></a></p><p>The purpose of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network is to improve obstetric care and outcomes for pregnant and lactating people and their babies by reducing maternal, fetal, and infant morbidity and maternal complications. This includes finding ways to reduce maternal mortality, complications, and morbidities related to pregnancy, such as preterm labor and pregnancy induced hypertension, labor, and postpartum recovery; reduce prematurity, low-birth weight, infant mortality, and morbidities; and expand the evidence base regarding the safety and efficacy of therapeutic products used during pregnancy and lactation. The MFMU Network serves as NICHD's primary and first-line infrastructure involved in implementing multisite obstetric clinical trials. &nbsp;The MFMU focuses on clinical questions in maternal-fetal medicine and obstetrics, particularly with respect to the continuing problem of preterm birth. The Network provides an infrastructure to conduct multiple large studies simultaneously, in both a cost-effective and timely manner. The participating clinical centers cover over 170,000 deliveries a year and are racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse, allowing study results to be generalizable to the US population. Results from MFMU Network studies have impacted clinical practice, both by finding treatments that prevent poor pregnancy outcomes and by stopping ineffective, costly, and potentially harmful therapies by providing the rationale for evidence-based, cost-effective obstetric practice. &nbsp;The 14 MFMU clinical centers with the DCC work collaboratively to implement common protocols to enroll and follow-up enough participants to achieve statistical power to answer protocol hypotheses more rapidly and definitively than individual clinical centers acting alone. Applications for the current MFMU funding cycle were submitted in response to&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-23-016.html">RFA-HD-23-016</a> and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-23-017.html">RFA-HD-23-017</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/nrn"><i>Neonatal Research Network</i></a><i>&nbsp;(NRN)</i></p><p>The purpose of the NRN is to improve healthcare and outcomes for newborns. This includes finding ways to improve the chances for survival without neurodevelopmental impairment for infants born premature, low-birth weight, or&nbsp;babies of all gestational ages&nbsp;with serious conditions. The NRN currently consists of a DCC and 15 Clinical Centers encompassing 38 hospitals with more than 137,000 births per year. NRN Centers have more than 34,000 neonatal intensive care unit admissions per year; 2,300 of these babies are born at less than 29 weeks gestational age. Applications for the current NRN funding cycle were submitted in response to&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-23-001.html">RFA-HD-23-001</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-23-002.html">RFA-HD-23-002</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/pelvicfloor"><i>Pelvic Floor Disorders Network</i></a><i>&nbsp;(PFDN)</i></p><p>The purpose of the PFDN is to study clinical and health aspects of pelvic floor disorders in women including pelvic organ prolapse, urinary urgency/frequency, urinary incontinence, and fecal incontinence. More specifically, relevant areas of study include understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of these conditions such that better preventative strategies as well as safe and efficacious treatments may be developed. Other relevant research areas include the development of novel and nonsurgical treatments to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence including regenerative medical techniques, projects that optimize the effectiveness of existing treatments and minimize harmful adverse events and studies focused on understanding the psychosocial consequences and alleviating the burden of living with pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and fecal incontinence. The Network, currently consisting of seven Clinical Centers and a DCC, provides the infrastructure, the recruitment capabilities and the research expertise needed to perform definitive, rigorous, and reproducible multisite studies under common protocols that will provide efficient, high quality, evidence-based&nbsp;data to guide both the surgical and non-surgical care for these large and ever-growing clinical problems.&nbsp;Applications for the current PFDN funding cycle were submitted in response to&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-22-021.html">RFA-HD-22-021</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-22-022.html">RFA-HD-22-022</a>.</p><p><strong>Additional Resources</strong></p><p>In addition to the Networks listed here, applications proposing to assess maternal and pediatric pharmacology interventions will be advised to utilize resources available via <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/opptb/mprint">NICHD&#146;s Maternal and Pediatric pRecisioN in Therapeutics (MPRINT) Hub</a> and the <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/ptn">Pediatric Trials Network</a> (PTN). MPRINT resources include, but are not limited to curated summaries of published literature around specific drugs, innovative approaches to maternal and pediatric real-world evidence extraction, clinical pharmacology and pharmacometrics, and model informed clinical trial design.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/ptn">Pediatric Trials Network</a> (PTN)&nbsp;provides an environment and the appropriate infrastructure for conducting regulatory rigorous pediatric&nbsp;and lactation clinical trials that lead to updates in drug labels as directed by the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/bpca/about">BPCA</a>). The Network is designed to address the longstanding concern of a paucity of FDA labels for off-patent therapeutics commonly used &#147;off-label&#148; in children or during lactation. Data collected from PTN trials help regulators revise drug labels for safer and more effective use in neonates, children, adolescents, as well as lactating persons and their infants. In addition, and in accordance with the BPCA legislation, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/2023-24_BPCA_Priority_List_5-23-2024.pdf">BPCA&nbsp;Priority List of Needs in Pediatrics</a> outlines key needs in pediatric therapeutics.&nbsp;Investigators who are interested in collaborating with the PTN on areas such as regulatory requirements for Investigational New Drug (IND) studies, methods developments or pharmacokinetic analyses of drugs, and/or are interested in proposing projects that align with the BPCA Priority List are encouraged to propose projects assessing medications and conditions that are a part of the BPCA mandate to improve knowledge in pediatric therapeutics.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, NICHD anticipates adding more Networks to this initiative in the future. If an investigator is considering a project that aligns with another NICHD Network (including the PTN and MPRINT HUB) or another area of science not directly aligned with the Networks listed in this NOFO, please contact this NOFO Scientific/Research Contact.</p><p><strong>PRE-APPLICATION PROCESS</strong></p><p><i>Prior to application submission, all proposals must first undergo a rigorous&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/clinical-research/clinical-trial-preapplication-process"><i>pre-application process</i></a>, during which the scientific scope and feasibility of potential projects will be assessed by the NICHD. Potential applicants are encouraged to start this process early to allow ample time to prepare and submit a competitive application in response to this NOFO. Longer timelines are likely for non-Network investigators. Timelines and instructions for the pre-application process can be found on the NICHD&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/clinical-research/clinical-trial-preapplication-process">Pre-Application Process for NICHD Network Multisite Clinical Research website</a>.</p><p><strong>APPLICATION PROCESS: UG3/UH3 PHASED MECHANISM</strong></p><p>This NOFO utilizes a different grant mechanism than PAR-23-037. Applications under this NOFO will operate under a two-phase, milestone-driven grant mechanism (UG3/UH3) consisting of a start-up phase of up to two years (UG3) and a full implementation, enrollment and follow-up phase of up to five years (UH3) for a maximum of seven <i>combined </i>years. Applications are expected to provide clear descriptions of overall project deliverables, timelines, and milestones and how they align with the goals of the study and the Network(s). The NICHD may negotiate changes to the study deliverables, timelines, and milestones as well as the process for their re-prioritization prior to award. Continued funding of the project will be dependent upon meeting milestones throughout the project including during both the UG3 and UH3 Phases, and it is expected that the study will be completed within the project period. The investigative team may be asked to re-prioritize and adjust activities, timelines, and milestones on a periodic basis based on feedback from the Network Steering Committee(s), External Scientific Matter Expert Committee, Community Engagement Board, Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and/or NICHD staff.</p><p><strong>Transition to the UH3 phase requires NICHD approval.</strong></p><ul><li>Any study that fails to meet their UG3 milestones will NOT be approved to transition to the UH3 phase.</li><li>In addition, it is not guaranteed that all projects that attain their UG3 milestones will be approved to advance to the UH3 Phase<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>That decision will be made by NICHD and only after review of the UG3 Phase results.</li></ul><p><strong>APPLICATIONS NOT RESPONSIVE TO THIS NOFO</strong></p><p>Applications to this NOFO that do not propose to utilize a NICHD Network or that did not receive NICHD approval of the Concept Proposal will be considered non-responsive. Additionally, applications proposing single center, animal studies, basic science or basic experimental studies involving humans are beyond the scope of this NOFO. Projects that are seeking infrastructure support for another Network are also beyond the scope of this NOFO. Applications that are deemed non-responsive will not be reviewed for this NOFO.</p><p><strong>NICHD DATA SHARING EXPECTATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html">NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing (Policy)</a> expects that researchers maximize the sharing of scientific data and data be accessible as soon as possible and no later than the time of an associated publication or the end of the award period, whichever comes first. NIH requires all applications submitted in response to this NOFO to include a Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMS Plan).&nbsp; The DMS Plan is expected to address the Elements as described in Supplemental Information to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing: Elements of an NIH Data Management and Sharing Plan (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-014.html">NOT-OD-21-014)</a>. The DMS Plan will be reviewed and approved by NIH Program Staff prior to award. Awardees will be required to comply with their approved DMS Plan and any approved updates.</p><p>For human clinical trial data, NICHD expects the use of the Data and Specimen Hub (DASH), a centralized resource for researchers to store and access de-identified data from studies funded by NICHD. Information about DASH may be obtained at&nbsp;<a href="https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/">https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/</a>. For projects generating large-scale human genetic data, applicants should provide a Provisional or Institutional Certification specifying whether the individual-level data can be shared through an NIH approved repository, such as dbGaP and the Sequence Read Archive, in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-14-124.html">NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy</a>.</p><p>If use of DASH is not feasible for a given data type (e.g. non-clinical data), NICHD expects awardees to share data through other equivalent broad-sharing data repositories.</p><p>For applications that aim to analyze existing data, DMS Plans should describe where and how other researchers can access that data to enable reproducibility and reuse.</p><p>Additional information on the Data Management and Sharing Policy is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/od/odss#resources">NICHD Office of Data Science and Sharing website</a>.</p>

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply- Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220522' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>All instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed. The following additional instructions apply:</p><p>The budget will be developed as part of the pre-application process and must include all study-related costs not covered by Network infrastructure awards. The application must provide detailed annual budgets that will enable the project to meet study milestones. Separate itemized budgets must be prepared for each subcontract. The services provided by the Network DCC&nbsp;and/or other Network components&nbsp;for these projects will be supported by their existing infrastructure awards and should not be included in the budget. These expenses should be described in the budget justification as being supported by these established grants. &nbsp;A description of funded Network responsibilities may be found by reviewing the corresponding RFAs (links included above) for the respective Networks.</p><ul><li><u>Salary</u>. The budget may include support for non-Network participating investigators, coordinators, and other necessary personnel. If additional Network infrastructure support is needed for a study, specific approval from NICHD will be required.</li><li><u>Travel</u>. The budget should include travel funds for non-Network PD(s)/PI(s) and other necessary personnel to attend face-to-face Network Steering Committee Meetings (at least 2/year) and other necessary project-related meetings for up to $1500 per person per trip.<ul><li>The budget should also include travel costs for one junior faculty member ($3000 per year per site) from all participating sites to travel to Steering Committee Meetings. &nbsp;A different junior investigator should be listed on each Network grant award such that the greatest number possible of junior investigators have the opportunity to participate in Network research.</li></ul></li><li><u>Other Direct Costs.</u> The budget may include, but is not limited to, the following other cost categories:<ul><li>Single IRB</li><li><u>Data Sharing</u>. The budget should also include DMS Plan costs including those associated with the preparation and submission of data into the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub (DASH) and/or other appropriate repositories approved by NICHD. All DMS costs should be summarized in the budget justification.</li></ul></li><li><u>Consortium</u>.<ul><li><u>Subcontracts</u>. The budget may include costs for subcontracts to non-Network sites.</li><li><u>Capitation</u>. Recruiting sites will be reimbursed when participants are enrolled to cover study-related costs that are not part of usual patient care. These may cover, but are not limited to, screening, consent approaches, pre-eligibility testing (e.g., research echocardiograms), study intervention implementation, research tests (lab tests, radiographs, etc.), investigational drugs/devices/etc., and participant incentives.</li></ul></li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;">The budget may include requests for funding to support the collection and storage of biospecimens (e.g. for mechanistic studies) as part of the protocol for subsequent study or sharing.&nbsp;It is anticipated that these projects will also lend themselves to ancillary studies and such projects are encouraged.&nbsp;Costs for biospecimen collection, storage during the award period, shipping to the NICHD Biorepository (for sharing through DASH), and cataloging submission to DASH should be included in the budget. Biospecimen sharing through the DASH/NICHD Biorepository will be based on a determination by NICHD.&nbsp;Investigators interested in conducting ancillary studies to Network projects should notify the Scientific Research Contact<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a2ecebe1eae68fecc7d6d5cdd0c98fe1cecbcccbc1c3cef0c7d1c7c3d0c1cae2cccbca8cc5cdd4"> in Section VI</a>. A list of projects being conducted by these Networks and supported via this funding mechanism can be found via the NICHD Network website or at any of the individual Network websites.</p><p>The budget may also include costs to perform secondary analyses of the proposed study data. However, given changes implemented with the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy (NOT-OD-21-013), it is anticipated that most secondary analyses will be performed by individual investigators using NICHD clinical study data published on the NICHD DASH. For secondary analyses performed by the Network, a strong preference should be given to junior investigators serving as the lead investigator on those projects with mentorship being provided by more experienced investigators.</p><p><strong><u>The NICHD may, at its sole discretion, decide to provide some of the requested elements of the budget as services provided by other NICHD or NIH contracts or cooperative agreement programs.</u></strong></p>
