                <p>This NOFO invites applications for investigator-initiated, high-risk multi-center observational studies involving more than one clinical center. Proposed studies should be hypothesis-driven and focus on a disease relevant to the mission of NIDDK. Planning activities must be completed prior to submission and are not permitted under this NOFO. Applicants who require a planning phase may first apply for an implementation planning cooperative agreement (U34; see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-090.html">PAR-25-090</a>). <strong>Consultation with NIDDK Scientific/Research Staff strongly encouraged prior to the submission of either a U34 or U01 application.</strong></p>

			 <a id='_bookmark207166' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>This NOFO invites applications for investigator-initiated, <strong>high-risk multi-center </strong>observational studies conducted at one or more clinical centers. A multi-center study is classified as &#147;high risk&#148; if it utilizes either a high-risk or invasive measure or has high operational risk, or both. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DK-20-051.html">NOT-DK-20-051</a> provides an explanation of high-risk versus low-risk studies. Proposed studies should be hypothesis-driven and focus on a disease relevant to the mission of NIDDK, including studies to address diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases. Proposed studies are expected to improve understanding, diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the diseases being studied, and should focus on research questions likely to have high clinical impact.</p><p>Examples of observational studies that would be appropriate for this NOFO if they are high risk include:</p><ul><li>Studies to provide incidence and/or prevalence data for a disease</li><li>Studies to describe the natural history or clinical course of disease</li><li>Studies to establish risk factors at the individual or population level for disease development or progression</li><li>Studies to assess the performance of a novel diagnostic</li></ul><p>For the purpose of this NOFO, a clinical research center may encompass one or more physical locations where the clinical study is being conducted -- i.e., where study participants are recruited, and/or are intervened upon and/or have outcomes assessed under a single protocol &ndash; as long as all locations are under the overall direction of a single investigator. A data coordinating center is not considered a clinical research center.</p><p><u>Definition of Risk</u></p><p>As explained in <a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DK-20-051.html">NOT-DK-20-051</a>, the risk level of a clinical trial or an observational study may be related to interventional and/or operational risk. The examples below provide general guidelines for risk assessment and are not exhaustive. <strong>Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIDDK staff </strong>to discuss their proposed study and determine the most appropriate mechanism for submitting their application.</p><p>Examples of high-risk study designs include:</p><ul><li>An intervention that has an unknown safety profile or has substantial side effects (including all studies requiring an IND/IDE application). This would include studies of a drug in a new population, or study of a licensed product for an unapproved indication;</li><li>A complex or invasive intervention, including diagnostic procedures;</li><li>A study involving complex assessment of multiple outcomes, including the ascertainment of outcomes using invasive research procedures;</li><li>Pragmatic trials proposing significant changes to standard of care practices, or significant coordination with multiple care providers and healthcare data systems;</li><li>A multi-center study involving more than minimal risk in vulnerable study populations (as defined in 45 CFR 46)</li></ul><p>Studies that do not meet the above criteria will generally be considered to involve low-risk interventions. Low-risk multi-center studies usually include the administration/use of a licensed product for an approved indication, or the provision of a routine intervention that could be used in the setting in which it is being studied (e.g., a lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss).</p><p>Examples of multi-center studies with high operational risk include:</p><ul><li>An inexperienced investigator, defined by lack of experience in conducting clinical trials, coordinating research across multiple centers, or recruiting the population to be studied;</li><li>A complex study design that involves standardization of research measures and outcomes collection and research data capture over multiple centers;</li><li>A study that involves the establishment of agreements with third parties that intend to utilize research study data to support regulatory filings with the FDA</li></ul><p>Multi-center studies that do not meet the above criteria will generally be considered to have low operational risk.</p><p>A multi-center study is classified as &#147;high risk&#148; if it utilizes either a high-risk intervention or has high operational risk, or both.</p><p><strong>Applications for low-risk multi-center clinical studies will not be accepted </strong>under this NOFO and may be submitted to <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-185.html">PA-20-185</a> or other appropriate NIH NOFOs.</p><p><strong>This NOFO will not accept applications for clinical trials.</strong></p><p><u>Overview of the NIDDK process for support of investigator-initiated, multi-center clinical studies:</u></p><p>NIDDK supports investigator-initiated, high-risk multi-center clinical observational studies through a two-part process: 1) implementation planning phase followed by 2) multi-center clinical study cooperative agreement (U01). <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-090.html">PAR-25-090</a>&nbsp;NIDDK Multi-Center Clinical Study Implementation Planning Cooperative Agreements (U34) provides support for the planning phase; this NOFO addresses the funding for the clinical study.</p><p>Part 1. Implementation Planning Phase</p><p>NIDDK will support clinical study planning (U34) cooperative agreements for high-risk multi-center clinical studies. The U34 is intended to support all administrative study group activities that are required in order to begin recruitment of participants. These activities include, but are not limited to: establishing the research team, developing tools for data management and oversight of the research, defining recruitment strategies, finalizing the protocol and investigators brochure, writing of the Manual of Operations, establishing a data and safety monitoring plan, and initiating the IRB approval process.</p><p>It is expected that receipt of a U34 will lead to the timely submission of an application (U01) for support of the full-scale study, incorporating the elements developed during the planning period. The goal of the planning phase is to ensure that the clinical study will be able to begin recruitment almost immediately, should a U01 be awarded.</p><p>Prospective applicants should note that funding of a U34 does not guarantee or imply funding for a subsequent U01 application.</p><p>Part 2. Multi-Center Clinical Study Cooperative Agreement (U01).</p><p>The U01 will support the conduct of the clinical study.</p><p>Planning activities are not permitted as part of the U01 application. It is expected that planning work done during the U34 phase, or through some alternative funding mechanism, will allow the U01 applicant to initiate study staff training followed by study participant recruitment as soon as the U01 award is made. Applicants who feel they have completed all the planning elements without a U34 may apply directly for the U01. Further information regarding the U34/U01 process supported by these companion NOFOs, including a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) can be found at: <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/human-subjects-research"><u>https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/human-subjects-research</u></a>.</p><p>Applications should include only one clinical study.</p><p>Many of the diseases or conditions within the mission of NIDDK disproportionately affect individuals from minoritized and underserved communities. NIDDK encourages research focusing on such populations, including individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, rural populations, sexual and gender minority groups and other socioeconomically disadvantaged and medically underserved communities. NIDDK places a high priority on clinical studies to understand and eliminate health disparities and promote health equity.</p><p>NIDDK is committed to conducting clinical studies that have been developed in partnership with patients, community members, families, healthcare providers, organizations, and other relevant partners who are affected by or have a direct interest in the research</span> (<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/strategic-plans-reports/pathways-health-all">Pathways to Health for All: Health Disparities &amp; Health Equity Research Recommendations &amp; Opportunities - NIDDK (nih.gov)</a>). Active and meaningful engagement should involve these individuals and/or organizations in the development, design, and execution of the study</span>, as well as in dissemination of findings.&nbsp;</span>Meaningful engagement must entail more than focus groups, surveys or other activities where people are only involved as participants or respondents. Rather, engagement approaches must involve bidirectional </span>and sustained communication and interactions that result in informed decision-making about high-priority research needs and issues that are important to&nbsp;</span>affected individuals, community members, and/or organizations, especially populations who disproportionately experience NIDDK mission diseases.&nbsp;</span>Engagement activities that bring to bear the expertise and lived experience of affected individuals and diverse communities may yield interventional, recruitment and retention approaches that are more likely to be acceptable and effective, and less likely to cause harm. Engagement that involves trust building and repairing when needed, and use of culturally appropriate research approaches (i.e., identifying the health problem, design, and materials) is an important method to enhance and assess research outcomes including recruitment and retention goals, specific health outcomes, and sustainability of efficacious interventions. Ideally, affected individuals, groups, and organizations are not only &#147;engaged,&#148; but integrated equitably into the research team which includes appropriate orientation and onboarding support to the team, and compensation.</p><p>Since the complete study design and protocol must be included in the U01 application, it is expected that investigators can demonstrate substantial engagement and partnership with appropriate individuals, community members, and or organizations prior to the U01 submission.</span></p><p><strong>This NOFO will only support research within the mission of NIDDK.</strong> Research applications in areas that are primarily within the missions of other NIH Institutes and Centers are not appropriate for this NOFO and will not be supported. NIDDK has many diseases within its <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/meet-director/mission-vision"><u>mission</u></a>, but all research related to relevant diseases may not be appropriate for NIDDK. <strong>Applicants to this NOFO are strongly encouraged to contact NIDDK staff as soon as possible in the development of the application and generally at least 12 weeks prior to the application date</strong>. NIDDK staff can help the applicant understand whether the proposed clinical study is within the goals and mission of the Institute and is appropriate for this NOFO. As part of the consultation process, NIDDK staff will consider whether the proposed clinical study meets the goals and mission of the Institute, whether it addresses one or more high priority research areas and meets programmatic needs, including balance across research areas, whether it is appropriate to conduct as an investigator-initiated clinical study, and whether appropriate funds might be available for the clinical study. During the consultation phase, if the proposed study does not meet NIDDK's programmatic needs or is not appropriate as an investigator-initiated clinical study, applicants will be strongly encouraged to consider other Funding Opportunities. If NIDDK ascertains that substantial additional preliminary data or planning may be necessary, the applicant will be encouraged to consider applying for funding under the appropriate NOFO. You should contact the Program<strong> </strong>Director responsible for <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/research-programs"><u>your area of research</u></a>. If you are not certain whom to contact, you should reach out to the contact for the appropriate scientific division listed at the end of this NOFO, and you will be directed to the correct Program Director.</p><p>This consultation process is distinct from pre-approval requirements for applications with budgets of $500,000 or more direct costs in any year, as described in Section IV.7.</p><p><strong><u>Applications Not Responsive to the NOFO</u></strong></p><p>This NOFO will only support research within the mission of<strong> </strong>NIDDK.

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply- Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>

CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a &#147;Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal" (<a href="http://cde.nih.gov/">http://cde.nih.gov/</a>) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.</p>

			 <p><strong>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES</strong></p><p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT AWARDS</strong></p><p><strong>RESEARCH PROJECT APPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS, CLINICAL STUDIES, PREVENTION AND CONTROL INTERVENTIONS, AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES</strong></p><p>The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies. The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below.</p><p><strong>The Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) will have the primary responsibility for:</strong></p><p>1. Developing the research design and study protocol, including definition of objectives and approaches, sample size and power calculations, and establishing procedures for participant recruitment and follow-up, data collection, quality control, interim data and safety monitoring, final data analysis and interpretation, and publication of results.</p><p>2. Establishing a Steering Committee to implement, coordinate and manage the project(s). Recipient(s) will name investigators to serve as members on a Steering Committee and other subcommittees, as appropriate, meeting periodically. Recipients will be required to accept and implement the common protocol(s) and procedures approved by the Steering Committee.</p><p>3. Designating Protocol Chairs. The Program Directors/Principal Investigators (for studies involving multiple protocols) shall designate a single Protocol Chairperson (if the Program Director/Principal Investigator does not assume this role) for each protocol to be carried out by the study group. The Protocol Chairperson shall function as the scientific coordinator for the protocol and shall assume responsibility for obtaining approval to implement the protocol from the Steering Committee and for developing and monitoring the protocol. Significant modifications to approved protocols must be approved by the Steering Committee.</p><p>4. Implementing collection of data specified by the study protocol. For a multi-center study, each recipient/site is required to ensure that data will be submitted expeditiously to the Data Coordinating Center. Additionally, individual investigators/sites must demonstrate the ability to implement the strategy specifically designed for their individual study population.</p><p>5. Establishing procedures for data quality, completeness, and security. Recipients are responsible for ensuring accurate and timely assessment of the progress of each study, including development of procedures to ensure that data collection and management are: (1) adequate for quality control and analysis; (2) for clinical trials, as simple as appropriate in order to facilitate cooperation/referral of study participants by physicians to avoid unnecessary expense; and (3) sufficiently staffed across the participating institutions. For research involving multiple sites, a plan for analysis of pooled data will be developed by the Steering Committee.</p><p>6. Submitting interim progress reports, when requested or agreed upon by both parties, to the NIDDK Program Official including as a minimum, summary data on protocol performance. For coordinated multiple awards or a multi-site single award, the NIDDK Program Official may require additional information from individual clinical sites. Such reports are in addition to the required annual noncompeting continuation progress report.</p><p>7. Reporting of the study findings. Recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current DHHS, PHS, and NIH policies. The recipient must also be adherent to Study Publication and Presentation Policy. The NIDDK will have access to and may periodically review all data generated under an award. NIDDK staff may co-author publications of findings with recipients consistent with NIH policies and network/consortium policies.</p><p>8. Any third-party collaboration (including but not limited to interactions with organizations from industry, academia, and nonprofit institutions) should be governed by a research collaboration agreement (e.g., Clinical Trial Agreement, Research Collaborative Agreement, etc.) or any third-party contract mechanism(s) with terms that ensure the collaboration is conducted in accordance with the Cooperative Agreement, applicable NIH/NIDDK policies and procedures, and network/consortium policies, and with written approval from NIDDK Program staff. Any relevant proposed third-party agreements related to the network/consortium studies between grantee and third-party will be provided to the NIDDK Program staff and NIDDK Technology Advancement Office for review, comment, and approval to assure compliance with NIH/NIDDK policies and network/consortium policies. Further, at the request of the NIDDK Program staff, any other network/consortium-relevant third-party agreements must be shared with NIDDK. Failure to comply with this term may prompt action in accordance with NIH Grants Policy Statement, Section 8.5 titled: &#147;Special Award Conditions and Remedies for Noncompliance (Special Award Conditions and Enforcement Actions)&#148;, and Section 8.5.2, titled: &#147;Remedies for Noncompliance or Enforcement Actions: Suspension, Termination, and Withholding Support&#148;, noncompliance with the terms and conditions of award will be considered by the funding IC for future funding and support decisions and may result in termination of the award.&#148;</p><p>9. Any involvement of a third-party (including but not limited to industry, academia, and nonprofit institutions) in the study and network/consortium activities that includes access to any network/consortium generated resources (i.e., data and bio-samples), or study results that are not publicly available, or using the name of the network/consortium or study or the name of the NIH or NIDDK, is permitted only after written permission by the NIDDK Program staff who will consult with others at NIH and NIDDK Technology Advancement Office.</p><p>10. Maintaining confidentiality of information: The recipient(s) will maintain the confidentiality of the information developed by the investigators (i.e., protocols, data analysis, conclusions, etc.) as well as proprietary information of an individual company or other entity collaborating with the study or network/consortium. Any exception requires written approval from NIDDK Program staff.</p><p>11.&nbsp;Data Management and Sharing Plan: In accordance with the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html">NIH NOT-OD-21-013</a>), the NIDDK approved plan will become a term and condition of award, be routinely monitored during the award period, and compliance may factor into future funding decisions. By the end of the funding or proprietary period, a recipient or study group may not continue to exclusively use or share study generated resources until those resources are available to the public via a NIDDK approved repository per the NIDDK approved plan. The NIDDK has established a Central Repository to support the receipt, storage, and distribution of data, bio-samples, and other resources generated in clinical studies funded by the NIH/NIDDK. When the NIDDK Central Repository is to be utilized, prior to enrolling participants, the PI or his/her designee will coordinate with the NIDDK Program and Central Repository staff to prepare for eventual archiving and distribution of the study generated resources that are to be maintained in the Central Repository. These resources will be available to the wider scientific community in accordance with the NIH Data Management and Sharing policy (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/</a> and,&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/sharing.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/sharing.htm</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_faqs.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_faqs.htm</a>), per the NIDDK approved data management and sharing plan.</p><p>12. Study investigators are required to publish and to release publicly and disseminate results and other products of the study, in accordance with study protocols, Steering Committee policies on publications, and the NIDDK approved Data Management and Sharing Plan.</p><p>13. Study investigators are required to comply with NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH Funded Clinical Trial Information as stated at <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/understanding/nih-policy.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/understanding/nih-policy.htm</a>. Per policy, the recipient is responsible for meeting the expectations of this policy. Refer to additional information at <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm</a>.</p><p>NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:</p><p><strong>An NIDDK Project Scientist/Project Coordinator with substantial involvement will:</strong></p><p>1. Serve as the contact point for all facets of the scientific interaction with the recipient (s). As required for the coordination of activities and to expedite progress, NIDDK may designate additional NIDDK staff to provide advice to the recipient on specific scientific and/or analytic issues. Such staff may include another Project Scientist or Project Coordinator, who will provide direct technical assistance to the recipients to optimize the conduct and/or analysis of the study; or who may assist in the coordination of activities across multiple sites.</p><p>2. For multi-center studies, participate in the Steering Committee that oversees study conduct. The NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator will be a full participant and voting member of the Steering Committee and, if applicable, subcommittees.</p><p>3. Serve as a resource to study investigators with respect to other ongoing NIDDK activities that may be relevant to the study to facilitate compatibility with the NIDDK missions and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.</p><p>4. Have substantial involvement assisting in the design and coordination of research activities for recipients as elaborated below:</p><p>a. Assisting by providing advice in the management and technical performance of the investigations, coordinating required regulatory clearances for investigational agents used in the study, which are held by NIDDK. The NIDDK may reserve the right to cross file or independently file an Investigational New Drug Application or an Investigational Device Exemption form with the FDA.</p><p>b. The NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator may coordinate activities among recipients by assisting in the design, development, and coordination of a common research or clinical protocol and statistical evaluations of data; in the preparation of questionnaires and other data recording forms; and in the publication of results.</p><p>c. Reviewing procedures for assessing data quality and study performance monitoring.</p><p>d. The NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator may be co-authors on study publications. In general, to warrant co-authorship, NIDDK staff must have contributed to the following areas: (a) design of the concepts or experiments being tested; (b) performance of significant portions of the activity; (c) participation in analysis and interpretation of study results and (d) preparation and authorship of pertinent manuscripts.</p><p><strong>The NIDDK Program Official identified in the Notice of Award will:</strong></p><p>1. Interact with the Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) on a regular basis to monitor study progress. Monitoring may include: regular communications with the Program Director/Principal Investigator and staff, periodic site visits, observation of field data collection and management techniques, quality control, fiscal review, and other relevant matters; as well as attendance at Steering Committee, Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and related meetings. The NIDDK retains, as an option, periodic review of progress by researchers not involved with the study.</p><p>2. Review and approve protocols prior to implementation to insure they are within the scope of peer review, for safety considerations, as required by federal regulations.</p><p>3. The NIDDK Program Official will monitor protocol progress, and may request that a protocol study be closed to accrual for reasons including: (a) accrual rate insufficient to complete study in a timely fashion; (b) accrual goals met early; (c) poor protocol performance; (d) patient safety and regulatory concerns; (e) study results that are already conclusive; (f) low likelihood of showing a benefit of the intervention (futility); and (g) emergence of new information that diminishes the scientific importance of the study question. The NIDDK will not permit further expenditures of NIDDK funds for a study after requesting closure except as specifically approved by the NIDDK.</p><p>4. Make recommendations for continued funding based on: a) overall study progress, including sufficient patient and/or data accrual; b) cooperation in carrying out the research (e.g., attendance at Steering Committee meetings, implementation of group decisions, compliance with the terms of award and reporting requirements); and/or c) maintenance of a high quality of research, which will allow pooling of data and comparisons across multiple cooperative agreement awards for common data elements.</p><p>5. Appoint an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as appropriate for Phase III clinical trials or other high-risk studies, or an Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB) for observational/epidemiologic studies; these Boards will review study progress, safety data, and interim results, as appropriate, and provide guidance to the NIDDK. The NIDDK Program Official or their Project Scientist or Project Coordinator will serve as the Executive Secretary and/or NIDDK program representative on the DSMB/OSMB.</p><p><strong>Areas of Joint Responsibility include:</strong></p><p>In addition to the interactions defined above, NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator and Recipients shall share responsibility for the following activities:</p><p><strong>Steering Committee</strong></p><p>A Steering Committee organized by the study investigator(s) will be the main governing body of the study.</p><p>The Steering Committee has primary responsibility to design research activities, establish priorities, develop common protocols and manuals, questionnaires, and other data recording forms, establish and maintain quality control among recipients, review progress, monitor patient accrual, coordinate, and standardize data management, and cooperate on the publication of results. Major scientific decisions regarding the core data will be determined by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will document progress in written reports to the NIDDK Program Official and will provide periodic supplementary reports upon request.</p><p>The Steering Committee will be composed of all Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s), (including those of data coordinating /statistical centers, if any) and co-investigators as deemed necessary, and the NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator. The final structure of the Steering Committee and voting procedures will be established at the first meeting. The NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator will have voting membership on the Steering Committee, and as appropriate, its subcommittees. The frequency of Steering Committee meetings will be dictated by a vote of the members of the Steering Committee. The NIDDK Program Official may serve as a non-voting member on the Steering Committee.</p><p>A Chairperson of the Steering Committee will be selected and voted on by the Steering Committee members. The Chairperson provides leadership to the Committee by conducting the Steering Committee meetings and by interacting closely with the recipients during protocol development and implementation. The NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator may not serve as Chairperson. The NIDDK Program Official will review the Committee&#146;s selection for potential bias, conflicts of interest, or lack of required expertise. If the Program Official has concerns regarding selection of the Chairperson which are not satisfactorily resolved, the Program Official may withhold concurrence if approved by the Director, Division of Extramural Activities, NIDDK based on written justification. In cases where Program Official concurrence is withheld, the Steering Committee will be required to make another selection.</p><p><strong>External Consultants</strong></p><p>An independent panel of External Consultants may be established by the Steering Committee. The External Consultants may periodically review interim progress of the project(s) and provide reports to the Steering Committee. Members of the panel of External Consultants may be asked, on an ad hoc basis, to participate in the peer review of applications for new research initiatives that utilize special &#147;opportunity pool&#148; funds. The NIDDK Program Official will review the Committee&#146;s selections for potential bias, conflicts of interest, or lack of required expertise. If the NIDDK Program Official has concerns regarding selection of one or more External Consultants which are not satisfactorily resolved, the NIDDK Program Official may withhold concurrence if approved by the Director of NIDDK Division of Extramural Activities based on written justification. In cases where NIDDK Program Official concurrence is withheld, the Steering Committee will be required to make another selection.</p><p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p><p>Any disagreement that may arise on scientific/programmatic matters (within the scope of the award), between award recipients and the NIDDK may be brought to dispute resolution. A dispute resolution panel will be composed of three members --one selected by the recipient (or the Steering Committee, with the NIDDK member not voting), a second member selected by NIDDK, and the third member elected by the two prior selected members. These special dispute resolution procedures in no way affect the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulations at 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D, and DHHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 16.</p>
