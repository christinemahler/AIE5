# 3 Lessons Learned

1. Deep research is not anything new necessarily. It's simply a complex combination of key concepts we've covered already in this bootcamp.
2. Prompt templates can be as simple or as complex as we need them to be.
3. There are various search tools and search tool configurations that may be leveraged to complete the research.
