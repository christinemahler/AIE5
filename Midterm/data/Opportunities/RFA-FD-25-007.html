			 <a id='_bookmark232151' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) outlines a new approach to food safety that is risk-informed and preventive in focus. In order to develop prevention-based systems, sample data and other information are needed to help identify and address hazards. There are different types of sample analyses that will be the focus of this project: routine human and animal food product testing, whole genome sequencing, and emergency response/emerging issues testing.</p><p>The LFFM mission is to enhance the capacity and capabilities of state human and animal food testing laboratories in support of an integrated food safety system (IFSS). This is achieved through prioritized sample testing and food defense preparedness in the areas of microbiology, chemistry, and radiochemistry, as well as method development and capacity/capability development projects that support and expand food safety and food defense testing.</p><p>The LFFM vision is that our nation&#146;s state human and animal food (HAF) testing laboratories are prepared, equipped, and continuously exercised for response to microbiological, chemical, and radiochemical food safety hazards requiring multi-state response and national coordination/support.</p><p>Human and animal food finished products as well as in-process and raw ingredient samples are analyzed to ensure they do not reach consumers with harmful contaminants, or to verify they contain ingredients at levels as declared on product labeling. Analysis of environmental swabs from food production facilities may also be analyzed as part of for-cause facility investigations in response to positive product samples.</p><p>Emergency response and emerging issue testing can take the form of either environmental (e.g., water, sediment, soil amendments, other complex environmental samples) or product testing and could include both.&nbsp; Emergency response testing is routinely conducted in response to outbreaks of foodborne illness to help identify the source of the disease-causing pathogen.&nbsp;Emerging issues testing allows the agency to gather information about potential food safety issues based on trends or intelligence the Agency or grantee might have.</p><p>This project will produce a large quantity of sample outputs that will drive a risk-based and prevention focused food safety system that both the FDA and our State partners can utilize for tracking and trending, early identification of emerging issues, and evaluation for future sampling initiatives and areas of focus.&nbsp;Participating laboratories will be equipped with additional resources that can be employed to build and increase sample throughput capacity and capability within their state.</p><p>The LFFM is a cooperative agreement program, and therefore the work accomplished within the Tracks is public health oriented and of mutual benefit to FDA and state partners. Specifically, within the Product Testing Tracks, FDA sets priorities for commodity-hazard pairs and LFFM labs select what work aligns with their goals, capabilities, and interests, in collaboration with State Regulatory Program (SRP) partners. Samples collected and analyzed under the LFFM HAF Product Testing Tracks may be for a variety of purposes: regulatory, surveillance, blinded studies, Total Diet Study (TDS), signals evaluation surveillance, baseline prevalence data, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Samples collected and analyzed under this cooperative agreement may derive from a variety of sources including but not limited to: an approved sample plan, emergency response and outbreak situations, national special security exercises, or an FDA assignment. Grantees may be invited to participate in FDA-issued assignments, which may have more stringent requirements regarding sampling, methodology, etc., as outlined in detailed planning and instruction documents. Outside of these FDA-issued assignments, states will have flexibility to utilize equivalent methodology, procedures, etc.&nbsp;Apart from FDA assignments and other FDA-directed samples (such as those collected by FDA or a 3rd party and submitted to a participating laboratory for analysis), the samples collected and analyzed under the LFFM Product Testing Tracks are state samples (collected by state regulatory program inspectors or laboratory analysts; and analyzed by state laboratories). These samples cannot be collected under FDA authority, and neither FDA credentials nor commissions can be used for collection activities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Program Goals:</strong></p><p>The LFFM mission is to enhance the capacity and capabilities of state human and animal food testing laboratories in support of an integrated food safety system (IFSS).

The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an&nbsp;Assurance of Compliance (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/form-hhs690.pdf">HHS-690</a>).

Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to FDA grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.</p><p>In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), FDA awards will be subject to System for Award Management (<a href="https://SAM.gov">SAM.gov</a>) requirements. SAM.gov requires Federal agencies to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently <a href="https://SAM.gov">SAM.gov</a>) prior to making an award. An applicant can review and comment on any information in the responsibility/qualification records available in SAM.gov. The FDA will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the information available in the responsibility/qualification records in SAM.gov, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.

See the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf">HHS Grants Policy Statement</a> for additional information on this reporting requirement.</p><p>In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 2 CFR Part 200.113 and Appendix XII to&nbsp; 2 CFR Part 200, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (Responsibility/Qualification in SAM.gov, formerly FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200 &#x00e2;?&#147; Award Term and Condition for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.</p>
