                <p style="margin-left:0in;">The purpose of this HEAL Initiative program is to: (1)&#x00a0;support basic and mechanistic pain research from R15-eligible undergraduate-focused serving institutions, health professional schools or graduate schools; (2) promote integrated, interdisciplinary research partnerships between Principal Investigators (PIs) from R15-eligible institutions and investigators from U.S. domestic institutions; and (3) enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution for health professional&#x00a0;students,&#x00a0;undergraduate and/or graduate students through active engagement in pain research.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Applications in response to this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) should include plans to accomplish these&#x00a0;goals. Specifically, applications should include a rigorous plan for conducting basic and mechanistic pain research in the Research Strategy section of the application<strong>.</strong> In addition, a research partnership between the PI&#146;s institution and at least one investigator from a separate U.S. domestic institution that provides&#x00a0;resources and/or expertise that will enhance the proposed pain research program must be included in a separate <strong>Team Management Plan.</strong> The proposed partnership will be a sub-award agreement(s) with at least one partnering institution, which does not need to be R15-eligible. The budget of all sub-awards must not exceed one third of the total budget. Furthermore, applications must include a <strong>Facilities & Other Resources document that</strong> demonstrates active involvement of health professional students, undergraduate and/or graduate students from the R15-eligible institution(s) in the proposed pain research projects.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220808' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The purpose of this HEAL Initiative program is to: (1)&nbsp;support basic and mechanistic pain research from R15-eligible undergraduate-focused serving institutions, health professional schools or graduate schools; (2) promote integrated, interdisciplinary research partnerships between Principal Investigators (PIs) from R15-eligible institutions and investigators from U.S. domestic institutions; and (3) enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution for health professional&nbsp;students,&nbsp;undergraduate and/or graduate students through active engagement in pain research.</p><p>Applications in response to this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) should include plans to accomplish these goals. Specifically, applications should include a rigorous plan for conducting basic and mechanistic pain research projects in the Research Strategy section of the application. In addition,&nbsp;a research partnership between the PI&#146;s institution and at least one&nbsp;investigator from a separate U.S. domestic institution that provides resources and/or expertise that will enhance the proposed pain research program must be included in a separate <strong>Team Management Plan.</strong> The proposed partnership will be a sub-award agreement(s) with at least one partnering institution, which does not need to be R15-eligible. The budget of all sub-awards must not exceed one third of the total budget. Furthermore, applications must include a <strong>Facilities &amp; Other Resources document &nbsp;</strong>that demonstrates active involvement of health professional students or undergraduate and/or graduate students from the R15-eligible institution(s) in the proposed pain research projects.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Helping to End Addiction Long-term<sup>&#x00ae;</sup> Initiative, or NIH HEAL Initiative<sup>&#x00ae;</sup>, bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the NIH HEAL Initiative is available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://heal.nih.gov/">https://heal.nih.gov/</span></a>.&nbsp;The initiative has funded multiple pain workforce enhancement programs that support early-career investigators. Despite these efforts, the NIH HEAL Initiative can benefit from additionally supporting R15-eligible institutions that involve undergraduate, graduate or health professional school/colleges students in pain research.</p><p>Since Fiscal Year (FY) 1985, NIH has made a special effort to stimulate research at educational institutions that provide baccalaureate and/or advanced degrees for a significant number of the nation&#146;s research scientists who have not been major recipients of NIH support. NIH has implemented two parent award programs, the Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) program (</span><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-21-155.html">PAR-21-155</span></a>) and Research Enhancement Award Program (REAP) (</span><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-060.html">PAR-22-060</span></a>), to provide research experiences to health professional or undergraduate and/or graduate students pursuing biomedical or behavioral research at U.S. higher education institutions. Utilizing these two programs will further promote a diverse&nbsp;pain research workforce. This&nbsp;</span>Pain Research Enhancement Program (&#147;PREP&#148;) will further support&nbsp;meritorious collaborative pain research from designated educational levels in the NIH HEAL Initiative, using the NIH Research Enhancement Award programs as a guide. Specifically, this NOFO aims to support new&nbsp;scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis by establishing new research partnerships that will lead to research experiences for undergraduate, graduate, and health professional students, to further enhance the pool of potential participants in the pain research pipeline.</span></p><p><strong>Program Objectives:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The purpose of this HEAL Initiative program is to: (1)&nbsp;support basic and mechanistic pain research from R15-eligible undergraduate-focused serving institutions, health professional schools or graduate schools; (2) promote integrated, interdisciplinary research partnerships between Principal Investigators (PIs) from R15-eligible institutions and investigators from U.S. domestic institutions; and (3) enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution for health professional&nbsp;students,&nbsp;undergraduate and/or graduate students through active engagement in pain research.<strong><u>Successful applications will include plans detailing how they intend to accomplish all three goals.</u></strong> Please refer to Section III for specific R15 eligibility information. Although preliminary data are not required for an R15 application, they may be included if available. The scientific foundation for the proposed research should be based on published research and/or any available preliminary data.</p><p><strong>Objective 1: Develop Small-Scale&nbsp;Basic and Mechanistic Pain Research Projects</strong></p><p>Proposed research projects should be hypothesis driven and use a rigorous scientific design to generate research data/evidence and advance scientific knowledge. Applications should include objectives that are attainable within the 3-year grant period.</span></p><p>Pain research projects may include, but are not limited to, the study of:&nbsp;nociception and/or pain processing in non-pain populations, acute pain, cancer pain, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, chronic pain, diabetic neuropathy, eye pain, gynecologic pain, headache, musculoskeletal pain, myofascial pain, obstetric pain, osteoarthritis, pain conditions across the lifespan (including in the context of aging), pain co-occurring with substance use disorders (SUDs), painful disorders of the orofacial region, painful neuropathy, post-stroke pain, post-surgical pain, sickle cell pain, and/or visceral pain. <strong>Innovative pain research topics that propose an interdisciplinary mechanistic pain research are considered high program priority under this initiative.</strong></p><p>Projects may focus on <strong><u>basic</u></strong>&nbsp;pain research with pre-clinical (<i>e.g.,</i> animal or <i>in silico</i>) models or <strong><u>involve research participants</u></strong> (<i>e.g.,</i> observational studies, epidemiological studies, secondary data analyses, or device development). Alternatively, investigators may propose a <strong><u>mechanistic and/or &#147;Basic Experimental Studies involving Humans&#148; (BESH) clinical trial</u></strong> as described below.&nbsp;</span>Clinical trials designed primarily to determine the safety, tolerability, and/or clinical efficacy of an intervention will be considered non-responsive to this NOFO and withdrawn without review.</p><p>For this NOFO, <strong>only the following types of clinical trials will be supported:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/besh.htm#definition"><strong>Basic Experimental Studies with Humans (BESH)</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>defined as basic research studies involving humans that seek to understand the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind.</li><li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/glossary-ct.htm#MechanisticStudy"><strong>Mechanistic trials</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>defined as studies designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention (i.e., <i>how</i> an intervention works, but not <i>if</i> it works or is safe)</li></ul><p>NIH defines a clinical trial as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html</a>).

However, it is expected that PD/PI(s) from R15-eligible institution(s) will lead the proposed project and complete most of the research at the R15-eligible institution. As such, PI(s) from R15-eligible institutions must</span> serve as the contact program director (PD)/PI for the project. Additionally, no more than one third of the total budget for the project may be used by the identified sub-award institution.</span></p><p><strong>Applications that propose new interdisciplinary are considered a high program priority under this NOFO.&nbsp;Interdisciplinary </strong>partnership could include, but are not limited to, any two or more areas of research expertise from the following:</span></p><ul><li>Clinical pain management (e.g., nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic interventions)</span></li><li>Clinical pain research</span></li><li>Preclinical/basic pain biology and modeling</span></li><li>Specific disease and/or pathological conditions (either human or preclinical models)</span></li><li>Animal behavior</span></li><li>Artificial intelligence</span></li><li>Data science</span></li></ul><p><strong>In addition, a Team Management Plan is required as part of Objective 2.&nbsp;</strong>Studies of team science have highlighted the need for effective management structures to achieve program goals. Many resources exist to aid in developing effective team-based programs (e.g., the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/crs/research-initiatives/team-science-field-guide/collaboration-team-science-guide.pdf">National Cancer Institute Collaboration and Team Science Field Guide</a>). The Team Management Plan focuses on management of the whole team/key personnel. Because teams will likely include individuals from widely divergent scientific backgrounds, teams must have a shared vision and a defined plan for communication and management of shared responsibilities, interpersonal interactions, and professional credit.&nbsp;The</span> Team Management Plan should be included as an attachment (three pages maximum) to this application. It should address how the research team, including the PI from R15-eligible Instiution and collaborator(s), will work together to accomplish program objectives.&nbsp;See the application instructions for &#147;Other Attachments&#148; on the SF424(R&amp;R) Other Project Information in Section IV.2 Instructions for Application Submission for details. The Team Management Plan should address the following points:</span></p><ul><li>Organizational structure and team composition and roles</li><li>Shared leadership, contributions, and distributed responsibility for decision-making</li><li>Resource sharing and allocation</li><li>Credit assignment and/or intellectual property (IP) rights</li><li>Coordination and communication plans</li><li>Intra-team data sharing, archiving, and preservation</li></ul><p><strong>Objective 3: Enhance the Research Environment by Engaging Students</strong></p><p>The third objective of this program is to enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution by engaging and providing research opportunities to health professional students or undergraduate and/or graduate students. <strong>A</strong> <strong>Facilities &amp; Other Resources document is required to describe how the proposed research will enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution.</strong> Two-thirds of the proposed research project team should comprise personnel from the R15-eligible institutions, including&nbsp;health professional students, or graduate students or undergraduate students from the primary R15-eligible institution.&nbsp;Although the proposed research project must be led by the identified PD/PI, <strong>applications with strong and innovative student engagement are of high program priority.&nbsp;</strong>If participating students have not yet been identified, the number and academic stage of those to be involved should be provided. Applications should identify which aspects of the proposed research will include student participation. Student involvement may include participation in the design of experiments, collection and analysis of data, execution and troubleshooting of experiments, participation in research meetings, and discussion of future research directions. When applicable, it is highly desirable that student participation also include presentation&nbsp;of research&nbsp;at local and/or national meetings (including the HEAL Annual Scientific Meeting and "Positively Uniting Researchers of Pain to Opine, Synthesize, &amp; Engage" {PURPOSE} meeting), publication of journal articles, and collaborative interactions. By engaging in these activities and collaborating on pain-focused research projects at&nbsp;early stages of training, students will be better prepared and motivated to pursue careers in &nbsp;pain&nbsp;research. Please see Section III for a list of eligible students.</span></p><p>This NOFO&nbsp;</span>aims to support pain&nbsp;research grants, not training or fellowship program</span>s. As such, <strong><u>applications should not include training plans such as didactic training or non-research activities related to professional development.</u></strong>&nbsp;Likewise, applications should not include independent student research projects. </span>For applications that propose a clinical trial, the PD/PI must be the responsible individual of record for oversight of the trial though students can take part in all components of a clinical trial. Oversight includes (but is not limited to): interacting with relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) staff; reviewing all informed consent documents; reporting potential serious adverse events; and maintaining responsibility for patient safety. However, the student can gain experience in all these components in conjunction with the individual leading the trial. Applications submitted to this NOFO may include additional investigators to those outlined above, including additional collaborators or consultants, or other individuals such as high school students, post-baccalaureate participants, postdoctoral fellows, or clinical fellows. However, involvement of such individuals does not fulfill the goal of enhancing the R15-eligible institutional environment and should account for less than one third of the overall proposed project team.</p><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><p><strong>Non-responsiveness Criteria:</strong></p><p><i>Applications deemed to be non-responsive will not proceed to review and will be withdrawn. Applications with one or more of the following characteristics are considered non-responsive to this NOFO:</i></p><ul><li>Research that does not address the <a href="https://heal.nih.gov/">NIH HEAL Initiative</a> mission to enhance pain management.</li><li>Failure to describe a proposed Research plan and specific aims primarily led by a PI from a R15-eligible Institution.</span></li><li>Omission of a domestic research partnership and accompanying sub award(s), or that include sub-award(s) that account for more than one third of the total project budget.</span></li><li>Failure to include the required Facilities &amp; Other Resources document and Other Attachments, including a Team Management Planand,</span> letters of support, including&nbsp;a letter of support from the identified subaward holder(s) and a letter of support from the R15-eligible institution&#146;s provost. Please see s</span>ection IV.2 &#147;Instructions for Application Submission&#148; for details.&nbsp;</li><li>Proposing a clinical trial addressing safety, tolerability, efficacy, and/or effectiveness of pharmacologic, behavioral, biologic, surgical, or device (invasive or noninvasive) interventions.</li></ul><p><strong>Contacting Program Officers Prior to Submission</strong></p><p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with&nbsp;<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/matchmaker">program staff</a> as plans for an application are being developed.</p><p><strong>Rigor and Reproducibility</strong></p><p>NIH strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, the&nbsp;NIH HEAL Initiative</span><sup>&nbsp;</sup>explicitly emphasizes the NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency (</span><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm</span></a>) and provides additional guidance from individual NIH institutes and centers (ICs) to the scientific community. For example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on rigorous and robust supporting data, which means that data should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.</span></p><p>Proposed research projects should incorporate adequate methodological rigor where applicable, including but not limited to a clear rationale for the chosen model(s) and primary/secondary endpoint(s), clear descriptions of tools and parameters, blinding, randomization, adequate sample size, prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria, appropriate handling of missing data and outliers, appropriate controls, pre-planned analyses, and appropriate quantitative techniques.</p><p>Applications should also clearly indicate the exploratory vs. confirmatory components of the study, consider study limitations, and plan for transparent reporting of all methods, analyses, and results so that other investigators can evaluate the quality of the work and potentially perform replications. NIH intends to maximize the impact of NIH HEAL Initiative-supported projects through broad and rapid data sharing and immediate access to publications (<a href="https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data">https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data</a>). Guidelines for complying with the HEAL Public Access and Data Sharing Policy can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://heal.nih.gov/data/complying-heal-data-sharing-policy">https://heal.nih.gov/data/complying-heal-data-sharing-policy</a>. More details about NIH HEAL Initiative data sharing are described in Section IV.</p><p><strong>Clinical Trial Accrual Policy:</strong></p><p>For applications that are proposing to conduct a clinical trial, a series of clinical recruitment milestones detailing completion of the clinical trial and providing contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances in attaining the clinical recruitment milestones must be included along with a study timeline in the PHS Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information form. Continuation of the award is conditional upon satisfactory progress, availability of funds, and scientific priorities of the NIH HEAL Initiative. If, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, NIH will consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phaseout of the award. NIH retains the option of periodic external peer review of progress. NIH program staff will closely monitor progress at all stages for milestones, accrual, and safety.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Expected Activities of Coordination</strong></p><p>NIH HEAL Initiative awardees are strongly encouraged to cooperate and coordinate their activities. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after post award by participating in PD/PI meetings, including:</p><p><strong>NIH HEAL Initiative Scientific Meeting Attendance</strong></p><p>Applicants and students</span> are highly encouraged to attend the annual NIH HEAL Initiative Scientific Meetings. The NIH HEAL Initiative hosts an annual meeting of more than 800 NIH HEAL Initiative-funded researchers across the initiative&#146;s research portfolio and career stage spectrum, NIH staff, people with lived and living experience, community partners advising initiative-funded projects, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders to</p><ul><li>Share research advances and cutting-edge science</li><li>Discover opportunities, challenges, and approaches to build on the initiative&#146;s progress</li><li>Connect and explore collaboration with other NIH HEAL Initiative-funded researchers and collaborators to enhance initiative-funded research.</li></ul><p><strong>Annual National Pain Scientists Career Development Program (PURPOSE) Meeting</strong></p><p>Applicants and students</span> are also highly encouraged to enroll in the HEAL Initiative: Positively Uniting Researchers of Pain to Opine, Synthesize, and Engage (PURPOSE) network and attend its annual meetings. Details can be found at <a href="https://painresearchers.com" Title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">https://painresearchers.com</a>. The HEAL R24 Coordinating Center for National Pain Scientists works to improve the collaboration between basic, translational, and clinical researchers who do not regularly collaborate or work together. One function of the HEAL R24 Coordinating Center for National Pain Scientists is to organize an annual meeting for established scientists as well as early-career pain investigators. This annual meeting facilitates the creation of a network of pain research mentors and mentees as well as fostering communication between scientists and clinicians of different disciplines and providing enhanced mentorship, leadership courses, and any additional training that might be helpful for early-career scientists. R15 recipients are encouraged to attend the annual PURPOSE meeting, either virtually or in person.</p>

Team management approaches raised in the subsections listed below should be described in the plan. Note that a &#147;Multiple PD/PI Leadership Plan&#148; may also be submitted as a separate attachment, and if it is included the information in that plan should not be duplicated here. Whereas the Multiple PD/PI Leadership Plan focuses on leadership by and interactions across the PD/PIs, the Team Management Plan focuses on management of the whole team/key personnel. Applicants are encouraged to consult resources to aid in developing effective team-based programs (see e.g., the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/crs/research-initiatives/team-science-field-guide/collaboration-team-science-guide.pdf">National Cancer Institute (NCI) Collaboration and Team Science Field Guide</a>).</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Organizational structure and team composition:</u> The Team Management Plan should clearly show the organizational structure and composition of the proposed project team.&nbsp;Two-thirds </span>of the proposed research project team should be health professional student trainees or graduate students or undergraduate students from the primary R15-eligible institution. The plan should describe a management structure based on project objectives that effectively promote the proposed research. The structure should account for team composition, institutional resources, and policies that conform with PREP objectives outlined in Section I.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Shared leadership, contributions, and distributed responsibility for decision making:</u> The Team Management Plan should include a description of how the proposed collaborators will work together to direct the overall scientific team to leverage the diverse perspectives, expertise, and skills of the team members to successfully accomplish the goals of the project. One key consideration is that teams employing multidisciplinary approaches and having diverse areas of intellectual and technical expertise are more productive if the process for making decisions incorporates different points of view. The Team Management Plan should describe how major decisions will be made or how conflicts will be resolved.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Resource sharing and allocation across the team:</u> Applications should describe management and decision-making processes that promote collective input for allocation of program resources with flexibility when resources may need to be dynamically reallocated to achieve programmatic goals. A plan for how intra-team, institutional, and regional resources that are integral to the team goals will be shared and made accessible to team members should also be included.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Credit assignment:</u> A plan for how credit and intellectual property (IP) will be shared, especially with the R15 institution&#146;s students, should be included. Methods for attributing contributions to publications should be described to enable individual professional assessment in joint projects.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Coordination and communication plans:</u> Practical aspects should be described, including frequency and logistics of real-time communication across all key personnel, consultants, scholars, early-stage investigators, etc., and other significant contributors regardless of effort level.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;">An important and meaningful impact of team science may come from shaping the next generation of pain scientists. Because of the interdisciplinary expertise of the research groups, students are exposed to and can learn a variety of scientific approaches and methodologies, resulting in multifaceted early-stage investigators. Plans for how student trainees will be immersed in and benefit from different approaches taken by the collective team program should be described. This could include shared mentorship, interlaboratory meetings, all-hands tutorials, shared meeting and document space, interlaboratory visits, and student presentations.</p><p><strong>2. Provost Letter(s) of Support:</strong> The application must include a PDF-formatted letter named &#147;ProvostLetter.pdf&#148; (without quotation marks).

Specifically, applications should include a rigorous plan for conducting basic and mechanistic pain research projects in the Research Strategy section of the application. In addition, a research partnership between the PI&#146;s institution and at least one investigator from a separate U.S. domestic institution that provides resources and/or expertise that will enhance the proposed pain research program must be included in a separate <strong>Team Management Plan</strong>. The proposed partnership will be a sub-award agreement(s) with at least one partnering institution, which does not need to be R15-eligible. The budget of all sub-awards must not exceed one third of the total budget. Furthermore, applications must include a <strong>Facilities &amp; Other Resources</strong> <strong>document </strong>that demonstrates active involvement of health professional students or undergraduate and/or graduate students from the R15-eligible institution(s) in the proposed pain research projects.</p><p>Although preliminary data are not required for an R15 application, they may be included if available. The scientific foundation for the proposed research should be based on published research and/or any available preliminary data.</p><p>A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.</p>

Outside of the core questionnaires, studies should select questionnaires from among the repository of supplemental questionnaires that are already being used by other NIH HEAL Initiative clinical pain studies. The program has created CDE files containing standardized variable names, responses, coding, and other information for all of these questionnaires. The program has also formatted the case report forms in a standardized way that is compliant with accessibility standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C &#x00a7; 794 (d); <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title29/html/USCODE-2011-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d.htm">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title29/html/USCODE-2011-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d.htm</a>) which &#147;require[s] Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.&#148;<ul><li>Studies that wish to use questionnaires not already included in the HEAL CDE repository should consult with their program official and the HEAL CDE team. New questionnaires will be considered for inclusion in the repository on a case-by-case basis and only when appropriate justification is provided.</li><li>NIH HEAL Initiative clinical studies that are using copyrighted questionaries are required to obtain licenses for use prior to initiating data collection. Licenses must be shared with the HEAL CDE team and the program officer prior to use of copyrighted materials. For additional information, visit the HEAL CDE Program (<a href="https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements">https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements</a>).</li></ul></li><li>To the extent possible, all other (nonpain) HEAL studies conducting clinical trials or research involving human subjects are expected to use questionnaires by the HEAL CDE Program (<a href="https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements">https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements</a>) if applicable and relevant to their research.</li><li>To the extent possible, NIH HEAL Initiative awardees are expected to integrate broad data sharing consent language into their informed consent forms.</span></li></ul><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Additional details, resources, and tools to assist with data-related activities can be found at </span><a href="https://www.healdatafair.org" Title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">https://www.healdatafair.org</span></a>.&#x00a0;</span> Budgeting guidance for data sharing can be found in&#x00a0;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-015.html">NOT-OD-21-015</a> and the&#x00a0;<a href="https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/planning-and-budgeting-for-data-management-and-sharing/budgeting-for-data-management-sharing#after">NIH Scientific Data Sharing site</a>.</p><p>All data collected as part of the NIH HEAL Initiative are collected under a Certificate of Confidentiality and entitled to the protections thereof.
