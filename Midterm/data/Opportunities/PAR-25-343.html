			</div>
		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>To investigate solutions to problems directly relevant to individuals with deafness or disorders of human communication in the areas of hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, and language. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) supports research and research training, including investigation into the etiology, pathology, detection, treatment, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes, primarily through the support of basic and applied research in anatomy, audiology, biochemistry, bioengineering, epidemiology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, the neurosciences, otolaryngology, psychology, pharmacology, physiology, psychophysics, speech-language pathology, and other scientific disciplines. The NIDCD supports: (1) Research into the evaluation of techniques and devices used in diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes; (2) research into prevention and early detection and diagnosis of hearing loss and speech, voice, and language disorders and research into preventing the effects of such disorders by means of appropriate referral and rehabilitation; (3) research into the detection, treatment, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes in the elderly population and its rehabilitation to ensure continued effective communication skills; and (4) research to expand knowledge of the effects of environmental agents that influence hearing or other communication processes.&nbsp;</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220473' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>The purpose of this funding opportunity is to encourage cooperative agreement applications to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders (NIDCD) for investigator initiated clinical trials in communication disorders (hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech and language) with the goal of advancing interventions into standard clinical care through well-designed and well-implemented clinical trials.</p><p>The NIH defines a clinical trial as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes. This funding opportunity&nbsp;is specifically intended for clinical trials that meet&nbsp;ANY&nbsp;of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Requires FDA&nbsp;oversight such as those requiring Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications</li><li>Have higher risks to participate for example:<ul><li>Involve a non-routine intervention&nbsp;</li><li>Involve utilization of unlicensed product/device</li><li>Involve utilization of a licensed product/device for an unapproved indication&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Pivotal clinical trials such as NIH defined Phase III Clinical Trial:<ul><li>An NIH-defined Phase III clinical trial is a broadly based prospective Phase III clinical investigation, usually involving several hundred or more human subjects, for the purpose of evaluating an experimental intervention in comparison with a standard or controlled intervention or comparing two or more existing treatments. Often the aim of such investigation is to provide evidence leading to a scientific basis for consideration of a change in health policy or standard of care.&nbsp;The definition includes pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions given for disease prevention, prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy. Community trials and other population-based intervention trials are also included.</li></ul></li><li>Clinical trial applications exceeding the annual direct costs of $700,000 or more, in certain cases, may also be a criterion for this funding opportunity.</li></ul><p>Only one clinical trial may be proposed per application.&nbsp;Each NIDCD U01 Clinical Trial award will support a single clinical trial. . Applications that include more than one clinical trial or other non-clinical trial studies will not be supported by this NOFO.</p><p>Drug, biologic, or device interventions require applicants to provide documentation from the FDA (see Section 4.5 of PHS Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information).</p><p>Clinical trials that do not involve FDA&nbsp;oversight, are not intended to formally establish efficacy (may inform subsequent studies but not aimed or sufficiently powered to directly change health policy or standard of care) and where the risks are no more than the potential risks encountered in routine medical care or procedures are encouraged to apply to the Parent R01 Clinical Trial Required NOFO.</p><p>&nbsp;Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Trinh Ly, prior to submission, to ensure this is the correct NOFO for their proposed research.</p>

			 <p style="margin-left:0px;">The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant administration regulations at 2 CFR Part 200, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Milestones proposed by the recipient will be reviewed by NIDCD and mutually agreed upon and included in Terms and Conditions.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for:</p><ul><li>accepting and implementing the goals, priorities, protocols, procedures, and policies agreed upon, including methods and requirements recommended by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) (see below), and handling of data, including appropriate sharing of methods and data with the community;&nbsp;</li><li>arranging appropriate approvals (when necessary) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with respect to the use of investigational interventions;&nbsp;</li><li>preparing the protocol and other study related documents for clinical trial supported by NIDCD (only one clinical trial may be proposed per application). The Clinical Trial Protocol Template for Phase 2 and 3 IND/IDE Studies developed by the FDA and NIH should be used (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-064.html">NOT-OD-17-064</a>) to prepare the protocol. The full completed clinical trial protocol and informed consent will be subject to review and acceptance by NIDCD. Activities not related to the scope of the NIDCD funded project should not be included in the protocol. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent will also be subject to review by a DSMB, if one is established for the study, in an advisory capacity only.&nbsp;</li><li>preparing, managing and ensuring all pre-implementation requirements are acceptable to NIDCD and completed in a timely manner prior to enrolling participants. Required pre-implementation documents include, but are not limited to, the establishment of a DSMB and charter, development of quality management standard operating procedures, study staff training log, site initiation visits, development of trial case report forms, confirmation of study intervention procurement, preparation of the Statistical Analysis Plan detailing analysis methods necessary for the clinical trial as well as the Manual of Procedures (MOP), and will be provided to the NIDCD;</li><li>ensuring upon implementation of the protocol, each field center (whether a single institution or a consortium of institutions), will follow the procedures required by the protocol regarding study conduct and monitoring, patient management, data collection, and quality control. Recruitment progress (including recruitment of women, children, and specific minority groups), safety, indices of quality control, and related operational features will be monitored by the recipient(s) and reported at regular intervals to the NIDCD Project Scientist;</li><li>monitoring and maintaining appropriate records for protocols, informed consents, assurances, and annual certifications of Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approvals for protection of human subjects and confidential information obtained by laboratories or data collected for the clinical trial;</li><li>managing the clinical trial recruitment, assessment, data collection, and analysis functions,</li><li>managing subsites including development of a contingency plan to evaluate performance and phase out of poor performing and/or unproductive subsites.</li><li>assuming accountability to the applicant organization officials and to the NIDCD for the performance and proper conduct of the activities supported by the U01 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award;&nbsp;</li><li>managing involvement of industry or any other third party in the study. Except for licensing of patents or copyrights, support or involvement of any third party will occur only following notification of and concurrence by the NIDCD; and&nbsp;</li><li>making all study materials and procedure manuals available in the public domain. The recipient(s) is expected to publish and publicly disseminate results, data, and other products of the study, concordant with governance policies and protocols.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;">Publications and oral presentations of work performed under this agreement will require appropriate acknowledgment of support by the NIDCD/NIH. The recipient(s) will register the clinical trial prior to enrollment of the first subject on the ClinicalTrials.gov protocol registration information website: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a>).</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current DHHS, PHS, and NIH policies.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The NIDCD will designate staff, including a Program Officer (PO) and a Grants Management Specialist to provide normal stewardship and administrative oversight of the cooperative agreement; these two contacts will be named in the Notice of Grant Award.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">An NIH Program Official within NIDCD will be designated as Project Scientist/Medical Officer for the clinical trial and will have substantial scientific programmatic involvement during conduct of this activity, through technical assistance, data sharing and analysis, composition of reports, and advice and coordination.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>The NIDCD Project Scientist:</strong> &nbsp;</p><ul><li>convenes an initial meeting with the PI and team, and the Program Officer as an observer;</li><li>has shared responsibilities in managing and sharing the broad clinical trial issues of the clinical trials, although the recipient has lead responsibilities in specific tasks and activities;</li><li>has access to data generated under this Cooperative Agreement and periodically may review the data and progress reports. NIDCD staff may use information obtained from the data for preparation of internal reports of the activities of the study; serves as a resource to provide scientific/programmatic support by participating in the design of the activities, advising in management and technical performance, or participating in the preparation of publications;</li><li>reviews, with the Program Officer, the annual or more frequent reports on progress of research activities; and</li><li>reviews the progress of the study, and of each participating facility, through consideration of the annual reports, routine reports, site visits, patient logs, etc. This review may include, but is not limited to, compliance with the study protocol, meeting patient enrollment and milestones targets, adherence to uniform data collection procedures, and the timeliness and quality of data reporting, and adequacy of adverse event management and reporting.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;">The NIDCD reserves the right to adjust funding, withhold support, suspend, terminate or curtail a study or an award in the event of a failure to comply with the Terms and Conditions of Award; substantial shortfall in acquisition or dissemination of tissues; lack of adequate data reporting or quality.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Areas of Joint Responsibility include</strong>:</p><ul><li>Teleconferences between the PI and Project Scientist at least quarterly to discuss progress. The Program Officer may be included.</li><li>Periodic reviews at least yearly of the clinical trial record of meeting established milestones; of defining practices regarding access to data and publications consistent with NIDCD policies; and of promoting and fostering inclusion of diversity in recruitment and enrollment.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Safety and Monitoring Board</strong>:</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established jointly by the PI(s) and NIDCD. The DSMB will review interim results periodically as established in the data and safety monitoring plan and report to the NIDCD Project Scientist. The DSMB will report in writing the recommendations of the DSMB to the NIDCD Project Scientist. A summary report that does not contain confidential information will be prepared by the DSMB and distributed to the Principal Investigator (PI). NIDCD will determine concurrence/nonconcurrence of the DSMB recommendations. The PI(s) will assume responsibility for implementing and reporting of the DSMB and the NIDCD recommendations to their Institutional Review Board.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16. control; other major breach of scientific conduct; or human subject ethical issues, whenever applicable.&nbsp;</p>
