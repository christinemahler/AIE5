			</div>
		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) supports applications to develop and implement a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for investigator-initiated multi-site clinical trials including efficacy, comparative effectiveness, pragmatic and/or implementation research clinical trials. Trials using innovative designs such as platform trials, adaptive, and Bayesian designs are encouraged. Trials for which this NOFO applies must be relevant to the research mission of the NHLBI and meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial (see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html">NOT-OD-15-015</a>). For additional information about the mission, strategic vision, and research priorities of the NHLBI, applicants are encouraged to consult the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/">NHLBI website</a>.<br><br>This NOFO will utilize a bi-phasic, milestone-driven cooperative agreement mechanism of award and runs in parallel with a companion NOFO that encourages applications for a collaborating Data Coordinating Center (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-193.html">PAR-22-193</a>). The objective of the CCC application is to present the scientific rationale for the clinical trial and a comprehensive scientific and operational plan that describes it. The application should address project management, subject recruitment and retention, performance milestones, scientific conduct of the trial, and dissemination of results. The application should also describe its approaches to increasing community engagement and diversity as well as reducing health inequities and disparities.<br><br>Both a CCC application and a collaborating Data Coordinating Center (DCC) application must be submitted on the same application due date for consideration by NHLBI. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate Scientific/Research contact prior to submitting an application.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark207166' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p><p>This NOFO supports applications to develop and implement a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for investigator-initiated multi-site clinical trials. Clinical trials supported by this NOFO include Phase II and above clinical trials that will enroll participants from two or more recruitment sites. Applications that propose to leverage resources and infrastructure of active clinical trial networks are also supported by this NOFO. This NOFO will utilize a bi-phasic (UG3/UH3), milestone-driven mechanism consisting of a start-up phase of up to one year (UG3) and a full enrollment and clinical trial execution phase (UH3). Applicants must address objectives for both a UG3 and a UH3 phase and are strongly encouraged to use project management principles, as appropriate. Proposed research may utilize a design anywhere along the continuum of efficacy, effectiveness, pragmatic and/or implementation research clinical trials. For this NOFO, pragmatic trials are considered those that test an intervention under the usual clinical conditions in which it will be applied, while efficacy trials do so under more idealized circumstances. Implementation trials test strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions and change practice patterns within specific settings. Innovative trial designs such as adaptive designs will be considered. The trial design should be appropriate for the study question. Trials for which this NOFO applies are expected to contribute to the evidence base for important health matters of relevance to the research mission of NHLBI, including approaches to increase diversity of participants in the research and reduce health inequities and disparities. For additional information about the mission, strategic vision, and research priorities of the NHLBI, applicants are encouraged to consult the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/">NHLBI website</a>.</p><p>A key characteristic of this NOFO is completion of core milestones. A core milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline that signifies the completion of a major project stage or activity. Milestones must be performance-based to achieve completion of the trial on time and on budget, and must be established for both the UG3 and UH3 phases of the project. These clinical trials are expected to be conducted with a high degree of efficiency, with streamlined administrative procedures wherever possible. Applications that address contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances in meeting the milestones are strongly encouraged.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phases of Award</strong></p><p>The UG3 phase will support the development of the protocol, manual of operations, and other resources necessary to the performance of the trial; further development of study partnerships; finalization of the protocol; Data and Safety Monitoring Board; and Single Institutional Review Board (see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-16-094.html">NOT-OD-16-094</a>) approvals of the trial protocol and informed consent(s)/assent(s); activation of clinical sites; and initiation of recruitment, which is expected to begin by the end of the UG3 phase.&nbsp;</p><p>For trials using an FDA regulated product and requiring an IND or IDE application to administer the product to humans, investigators must (1) secure IND authorization or IDE approval and (2) provide documentation of this authorization or approval to NHLBI before a funding decision will be made. Necessary drugs, devices, or other resources must be obtained by the end of the UG3 award to allow for the successful launch and execution of the proposed clinical trial in the UH3 phase.&nbsp;</p><p>Investigators and NHLBI will review and mutually agree upon the milestones that will be included in the Terms and Conditions of the grant, if awarded. Transition to the UH3 phase is predicated on the successful completion of all core milestones proposed and peer-reviewed for the UG3 phase of the application. The core milestones must be met during the UG3 phase to allow for successful launch of the full trial in the UH3 phase of the clinical trial. The overall planned enrollment and percentage of active clinical sites expected by the end of the UG3 phase will be agreed upon between the grantee organization (or recipient) and the NHLBI prior to an award. Enrollment of participants into the clinical trial is expected to begin before the end of the UG3 phase to optimize the probability of successfully completing the trial on time and on budget. NHLBI will conduct an administrative review approximately 9 months into the UG3 phase to determine progress toward achievement of milestones included in the Notice of Award. Milestones and timelines for the UH3 phase may be revised and finalized at the time of the UG3/UH3 transition. Less than satisfactory progress in the UH3 phase may lead to phasing out the award.&nbsp;</p><p>Milestones must address timing of overall recruitment/enrollment and retention goals, including accrual goals for women, minorities, and individuals of all ages including children and older adults. It is expected that, if funded, both the CCC and DCC will be responsible for milestone completion but that only one party, the CCC or the DCC, will be responsible for recording the completion of both CCC and DCC milestones through <a href="http://econnect.nhlbi.nih.gov/econnect/">eConnect</a>, an NHLBI platform that facilitates transfer of electronic information to NHLBI. Subject to NHLBI funding availability and scientific priorities, UH3 awards will be made after administrative review with specific attention to the extent to which all agreed-upon milestones have been met. If the UH3 is funded, NHLBI will review the progress of the clinical trial on a regular basis. Slower than anticipated progress towards meeting milestones will result in a re-evaluation of the award by NHLBI including whether the objectives of the trial can be met on time and on budget. If milestones have not been satisfactorily met, subsequent funding years may not be approved and may lead to phasing out the award.&nbsp;</p><p>NHLBI policies regarding milestones and relevant clinical research/studies policies are described in the following: <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human-subjects/accrual-guidelines">NHLBI Accrual of Human Subjects (Milestones) Policy</a>, <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human-subjects/women-minority-policy">NHLBI Policy for Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research</a>, <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human-subjects/data-safety-monitoring-policy">NHLBI Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring of Extramural Clinical Studies,</a> <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html">NIH Single IRB Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/nhlbi-policy-for-data-sharing-from-clinical-trials-and-epidemiological-studies">NHLBI Data Sharing Policy</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This CCC NOFO runs in parallel with a companion NOFO (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-193.html">PAR-22-193</a>) for a collaborating Data Coordinating Center (DCC) application. Both a CCC application and a collaborating DCC application must be submitted on the same due date for consideration by NHLBI. CCC (UG3/UH3) applications submitted without a collaborative DCC (U24) application will be deemed incomplete and <strong>will not </strong>proceed to review.</p><p><strong>Clinical Studies Not Supported by this NOFO</strong></p><p>The following types of clinical studies are not intended to be supported by this NOFO and will not proceed to peer review:</p><ul><li>Phase I (first-in-human) trials, whether single or multi-site</li><li>Single site trials</li><li>Drug or device safety trials</li><li>Multi-site observational studies that do not meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial (see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HL-18-611.html">NOT-HL-18-611</a>)</li><li>Mechanistic or Basic Experimental Studies in Humans (BESH) (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HL-19-690.html">NOT-HL-19-690</a>)</li></ul><p><br><strong>Prior to Submission&nbsp;</strong><br>Applicants are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged to consult with the Scientific/Research contacts for the area of science for which they are planning to develop an application <strong>prior to submission</strong> to confirm the NHLBI-specific clinical trial NOFO to which the application should be submitted. Early contact (at least 12 weeks prior to submission) is encouraged. This period of time provides an opportunity for NHLBI staff to discuss the scope and goals, and to provide information and guidance to potential applicants. Additionally, a staff consultation is required when direct costs are $500,000 or higher (see <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/applications-with-direct-costs-of-500000-or-more-in-any-one-year">NHLBI policy</a> regarding direct costs of $500,000 or more).</p><p><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-22-019.html">Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Every facet of the United States scientific research enterprise&mdash;from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation&ndash;requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. NIH&#146;s ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further NIH's mission. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences.

Third party support of the proposed research activity (if approved) will be incorporated as a specific term and condition in the Notice of Award. If the Third Party support ceases and the trial is no longer tenable without the Third Party support, a close-out plan may be requested. Applicants are reminded that although Cost Share is not required, if these types of costs are included in the research application and peer reviewed, it is expected that these costs will not be covered by NHLBI.&nbsp;</p><p>Include budget support for personnel to travel to an annual in-person Steering Committee meeting and/or other meeting of investigators and NHLBI program staff to be held in the Washington, D.C. area.&nbsp;</p><p>Include budget support for publication, dissemination of results, and data sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>Budgets should request only the costs that will be required for the activities to be performed in a given year. Generally, the NHLBI expects the requested costs in year 1 (UG3) to be lower than in the following years, depending on recruitment targets.

			 <p>The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant administration regulations at 2 CFR Part 200, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies.</p><p>The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and NIH as defined below.</p><p><strong>The PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for:</strong></p><ul><li>Recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current HHS, PHS, and NIH policies.&nbsp;</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;">The awardee PD/PI will have primary and lead responsibilities for the project as a whole, including research design and protocol development, participant recruitment and follow-up, data collection, quality control, interim data and safety monitoring, final data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, as well as collaborations with other awardees.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Upon completion of the project, awardees are expected to put their data into the public domain and/or make them available to other investigators, according to the approved plan for making data and materials available to the scientific community (see "Areas of Joint Responsibility" below). Third Party support of the proposed research activity (if proposed, accepted and approved) will be incorporated as a Special Award Condition in the NoA. Awardees will be responsible for ensuring third party compliance. If the third party support is no longer available and not replaceable in a timely fashion, negotiated phase-out of the award may occur. Cost Share is not a requirement for this program; however, if cost share is proposed, peer reviewed and accepted by NHLBI it will become a Special Award Condition in the NoA.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current DHHS, PHS, and NIH policies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The NHLBI Project Scientist will assist with development of research protocols, monitor patient recruitment and study progress, ensure disclosure of conflicts of interest, and ensure adherence to NHLBI policies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The NHLBI Project Scientist will serve on the Steering Committee and other study committees, when appropriate, as a non-voting member. The NHLBI Project Scientist may work with awardees on issues coming before the Steering Committee such as recruitment, protocol development, follow-up, quality control, adherence to protocol, possible changes to the protocol, interim data and safety monitoring, final data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, and development of solutions to major problems, such as insufficient participant enrollment.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition to the Project Scientist, a separate NHLBI Program Official will be responsible for the normal program stewardship of the cooperative agreement, and will be in the Notice of Award. However, NHLBI may elect to have a dual-role approach where a single individual may act as both the NHLBI Project Scientist and Program Official. Final decision-making authority on matters of budgetary and funding actions, grants management actions, and management of intellectual property issues is assigned to NHLBI staff other than the Project Scientist. The responsibility for final decision making may reside with Senior Institute management, separate organizational components and/or oversight committees. Because it is anticipated that the Program Official will participate in activities that rise to a level of involvement (i.e., additional role as Project Scientist) that results in conflicts of interest, for example, co-publication, other staff members such as direct line supervisors and/or other Senior NHLBI Program management staff will serve as agency Program Officials and will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award. The NHLBI policy on authorship and manuscript review of NHLBI sponsored extramural research protects against conflicts of interest with the Program Officer.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established to oversee participant safety in the clinical trial and provide overall monitoring of interim data and safety issues. As part of the collaborative activities under this cooperative agreement, the NHLBI will collaborate with the awardees to appoint and/or agree upon a single DSMB for monitoring the clinical trial. The DSMB may be appointed by the NHLBI, or with the approval of NHLBI, the DSMB could be an institutional DSMB. At the first meeting in the UG3 phase, the DSMB will review the awardee&#146;s protocol and potentially recommend modifications. Subsequently, the DSMB will monitor and review recruitment, adverse events, data quality, outcome data, and overall awardee performance. The DSMB has the responsibility to review interim data and final data, and recommend whether the protocol should be modified, and, at each meeting, whether the study should be continued or should be terminated early. An NHLBI scientist other than the NHLBI Program Official or Project Scientist will serve as Executive Secretary to the Board. Because the DSMB serves as an independent group advisory to the NHLBI, study investigators shall not communicate with DSMB members regarding study issues, except as authorized by the Board's Executive Secretary.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The NHLBI reserves the right to phase-out or curtail the study (or an individual award) in the event of: (a) failure to develop or implement a mutually agreeable protocol, (b) substantial shortfall in subject recruitment milestones, core milestones mutually agreed upon by the recipient organization and PD/PI and the NHLBI, consortium participation and collaboration with other awardees, (c) substantive changes in the agreed-upon methodologies and tools with which NIH cannot concur, (d) human subject ethical issues that may dictate a premature termination, or (e) results that substantially diminish the scientific value of study continuation.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Additionally, an agency program official or IC program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.</li></ul><p><strong>Areas of Joint Responsibility include:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0px;" data-suggestion-start-before="insertion:e71418f1d573743e162ded5cdfb8c0a51:BARFORDK_158">The Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) is responsible for communicating progress on achievement of each milestone for the collaborative project to the NHLBI Grants and Program Officers listed on the Notice of Award. Award continuation, even during the period recommended for support, is conditional upon satisfactory progress. If, at any time, recruitment, as defined in the NHLBI Accrual of Human Subjects (Milestones) Policy, falls significantly below projections, or core milestones mutually agreed upon by the recipient organization and PD/PI and the NHLBI are not met, the NHLBI may consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award. NHLBI Grants Management and Program Officers will closely monitor progress at all trial stages including milestones, accrual, and safety.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to their data developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current HHS, PHS, and NIH policies. Meetings and calls may be arranged by NHLBI staff to promote sharing of information among investigators regarding state of science technologies, data management techniques, analytical strategies and tools, and data sharing. Support or other involvement of industry or any other third party in the study (e.g., participation by the third party; involvement of study resources or citing the name of the study or NHLBI support; or special access to study results, data, findings or resources) may be advantageous and appropriate. However, except for licensing of patents or copyrights, support or involvement of any third party will occur only following notification of and concurrence by NHLBI.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">NHLBI will partner with the PD/PI to ensure that the dataset preparation is congruent with requirements for NHLBI data repository datasets and associated documentation for submission to the Biological Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (<a href="https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/">BioLINCC</a>) and the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/nhlbi-policy-for-data-sharing-from-clinical-trials-and-epidemiological-studies">NHLBI Policy for Data Sharing from Clinical Trials and Epidemiological Studies</a>, and is in accordance with the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/guidelines-for-preparing-clinical-study-data-sets-for-submission-to-the-nhlbi-data-repository">Guidelines for NHLBI Data Set Preparation</a>.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Study investigators are strongly encouraged to publish and to release publicly and disseminate results, tools, resources and other products of the study, in accordance with the study protocols and governance. It is expected that all methods, analyses, software, and algorithms will be made available in a timely manner to the scientific community. A plan for dissemination of study results will be developed by the awardee PD/PI in collaboration with the NIH Project Scientist and incorporated as a Special Term and Condition in the NoA. Within 3 years of the end of the period of NHLBI support for the project, data not previously released and other study materials or products not previously distributed are expected to be made available to individuals who are not study investigators in accordance with the <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/datasharing.htm.">NHLBI Data Sharing Policy</a> </p><p><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong></p><p>Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and HHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Multiple PD/PI Dispute Resolution</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">If a conflict develops between PD(s)/PI(s) in a multiple PD/PI application, the following procedures will apply:</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The Departmental administrators representing the PD(s)/PI(s) shall meet and attempt in good faith to settle any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the interpretation, performance or breach of this disagreement. However, if the Departmental administrators fail to reach resolution in 30 days then NIH may invoke dispute resolution procedures as described in the above paragraph.</p>
