                <p>The Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and Advance Health Equity initiative is soliciting applications to support unusually innovative intervention research addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) which, if successful, would have a major impact on preventing, reducing, or eliminating health disparities and advancing health equity. Projects should clearly demonstrate, based on the strength of the logic, a compelling potential to produce a major impact on advancing NIH&#146;s commitment to addressing SDOH to accelerate progress in improving health for all. Preliminary data are not required for this initiative.</p>

		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>Nurses understand that improving health and well-being means addressing people&#146;s needs in multiple settings, contexts, and over the whole life course. Science supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) uses this holistic perspective to improve individual and population health and advance health equity. NINR-supported science uses nursing science&#146;s unique, patient and community-focused perspective and wide reach across clinical and community settings to advance our understanding of the social determinants of health: those factors that are at the root of the inequities that we see. NINR has a longstanding and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists: those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science into the future.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220473' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><h4>Purpose</h4><p>This funding opportunity supports unusually innovative intervention research which, if successful, would have a major impact on preventing, reducing, or eliminating health disparities and advancing health equity. Interventions addressing research questions that target social determinants of health (SDOH), which include structural factors and conditions of daily life, are required for this initiative (See NIH SDOH conceptualization here <a href="https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/nih-sdohrcc#tabs2">https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/nih-sdohrcc#tabs2</a>). <i>As conceptualized by the NIH, family- and individual-level social and economic circumstances may reflect the downstream effects of SDOH but are not SDOH themselves. As such, applications proposing interventions that address family- and individual-level social and economic circumstances (e.g., food insecurity) alone, without addressing SDOH as conceptualized by NIH, will not be considered responsive to this funding opportunity.</i> Although a formative research phase may be necessary for some projects, an intervention research component addressing SDOH is required. SDOH can be addressed alone or in combination with other determinants of health and as part of a single or multilevel intervention approach. &nbsp;Applicants may propose interventions addressing disparities in any health condition, disease, or health behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>This initiative invites intervention research focused on transformative research ideas. To be considered transformative, projects should reflect ideas substantially different from traditional concepts and have high potential to lead to major improvements in health through the development, implementation, or dissemination of innovative interventions to address health disparities and health inequities. To accelerate progress in reducing health disparities, this funding opportunity seeks to support interventions that advance or solidify strategies, policies, programs, and environmental changes to address the Nation&#146;s most pressing health challenges. Innovative interventions could take many forms depending on the population of interest and health disparity being addressed. Note that "innovation" can include development and testing of an innovative intervention, new implementation and/or dissemination strategies for evidence-based interventions, and/or creative evaluation of a novel or unusual policy, program, or environmental change to provide insight into their health impacts.</p><p>Several key features of this funding opportunity are designed to emphasize that Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and Advance Health Equity applications are different from conventional, investigator-initiated research applications. These applications focus on the significance of the problem, the novelty of the hypothesis and/or the proposed methodology, and the magnitude of the potential impact rather than on preliminary data. No preliminary data are required for applications submitted in response to this funding opportunity, but could be included if available. Applicants should keep the goal of the Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and Advance Health Equity initiative in mind throughout the process &ndash; to develop, implement, disseminate, and/or evaluate innovative interventions and strategies that address health disparities and that seek to advance health equity.</p><p>To support the most innovative and impactful research, the NIH recognizes the need to promote a diverse research workforce. For more information, see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html">NOT-OD-20-031</a>, Notice of NIH&#146;s Interest in Diversity. NIH expects applicant institutions to engage in outreach and recruitment activities to encourage researchers from diverse backgrounds, including individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, persons with disabilities, and women to apply to participate in the program. In addition, outstanding research is conducted at a broad spectrum of institutions. To support the highest quality research, this funding opportunity encourages applications from the full range of eligible institutions, including those that may serve primarily underrepresented groups, those that may be less research active, and from all domestic geographic locations.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Program Considerations</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Consistent with existing NIH practices and applicable law: (1) Funded programs may not use the race, ethnicity, or sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, or transgender status) of a researcher, trainee, faculty candidate, or other program participants as an eligibility or selection criterion, and (2) NIH does not use the race, ethnicity, or sex of researchers, trainees, faculty, or other program participants in the application review process or funding decisions.&nbsp; Applicants and award recipients are encouraged to consult with their General Counsel to ensure all applicable laws and regulations are being followed in program design and implementation.<br><strong>Key Definitions for this NOFO</strong><br>Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, learn, work, play, live, and age, and the wider set of structural factors shaping the conditions of daily life. These structural factors include social, economic, and legal forces, systems, and policies that determine opportunities and access to high quality jobs, education, housing, transportation, built environment, information and communication infrastructure, food, and health care; the social environment; and other conditions of daily life. See <a href="https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/nih-sdohrcc">https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/nih-sdohrcc</a> for additional detail on the NIH SDOH Conceptualization.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>Despite scientific and technological discoveries that improved the health of the U.S. population overall, racial and ethnic minority populations and other populations marginalized by society continue to bear a disproportionate burden of disease and premature death. The life expectancy at birth for Black/African American and American Indian/Alaska Native populations is 6 and 11 years lower than for the non-Hispanic White population. Across diseases and conditions, these disparities deepen with a large variance attributed to historical injustices and present social inequities that limit the opportunity of communities and populations to live and maintain lives that are health-promoting. These factors are known as SDOH which shape individual, community, and population health across the life span.</p><p>Populations that experience health disparities have higher levels of cumulative exposure to adverse SDOH such as concentrated poverty, lower-quality education and employment opportunities, poor housing affordability, and lower accessibility of healthy food. Health disparity populations also have limited access to health-promoting social conditions, which further limits the optimization of health. Structural factors, rooted in racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, and other discriminatory systems, shape the extent to which conditions of daily life are equitably distributed or unfairly distributed by race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, socioeconomic position, sexual orientation, or geography, and their intersections. Inequitable exposure to adverse or health-promoting conditions of daily life are underlying causes of persistent and pervasive health disparities.</p><p>To make greater progress in fulfilling the NIH mission to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, innovative and transformative approaches to addressing and removing longstanding barriers to advancing health equity are critical. This requires a sustained focus on addressing adverse SDOH and expanding access to health-promoting SDOH among populations at a health disadvantage. To effectively accomplish this, strong community partnerships are necessary to ensure relevance and resonance of approaches to tackle and ultimately eliminate longstanding and pervasive issues that contribute to poor health outcomes. Community partnerships are essential for developing feasible and acceptable approaches and achieving acceptance, uptake, and sustainability of proposed interventions and strategies. Partnerships within and across sectors such as education, housing, transportation, commerce, agriculture, economic and urban development, justice, human and social services, and public health are critical to advancing the translation of findings into sustainable community- and system-level changes that will have lasting impacts on health and advance health equity.</p><h4>Research Objectives</h4><p>Projects are expected to propose exceptionally innovative and transformative activities that are urgently needed to prevent, reduce, or eliminate health disparities and advance health equity. Projects may prospectively test new or adapted interventions (referred to as prospective interventions), evaluate existing or upcoming novel or unusual policy, programmatic, or environmental changes to generate significantly novel insights, or conduct innovative dissemination and implementation research. Research projects must address one or more SDOH as conceptualized by the <a href="https://www.ninr.nih.gov/research/nih-sdohrcc#tabs2">NIH</a>. SDOH can be addressed alone or in combination with other determinants of health and as part of a single or multilevel intervention approach. <i>As conceptualized by the NIH, family- and individual-level social and economic circumstances may reflect the downstream effects of SDOH but are not SDOH themselves. As such, applications proposing interventions that address family- and individual-level social and economic circumstances (e.g., food insecurity) alone, without addressing SDOH as conceptualized by NIH, will not be considered responsive to this funding opportunity.</i> Studies should be guided by a conceptual framework identifying hypothesized pathways between the intervention or program and outcome(s). All projects should examine the mechanisms by which the intervention alters health and health disparities.</p><p>Projects must include a focus on one or more NIH-designated populations that experience health disparities in the US, which includes racial and ethnic minority populations, people with lower socioeconomic status, underserved rural populations, sexual and gender minority populations, people with disabilities, and any subpopulations that can be characterized by the intersection of two or more of these descriptors. As appropriate, studies are encouraged to explicitly examine whether the intervention mitigates differences in health outcomes between health disparity and non-health disparity populations. Given the heterogeneity within health disparity populations, within-group comparisons of intervention effects that allow for discovery of health risk and protective factors are also encouraged.</p><p>Innovative approaches to identifying, understanding, and developing strategies for overcoming barriers to the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, tools, policies, and guidelines are of interest. Implementation research aims should be guided by equity-oriented theoretical models and frameworks. Projects that focus on de-implementation of interventions that are ineffective, unproven, low-value, or harmful in advancing health equity are also invited. Research that directly tests the effectiveness of SDOH interventions in narrowing health gaps between health disparity and non-health disparity populations is also strongly encouraged.</p><p><i><u>Community Partnerships</u></i>: Projects must document or demonstrate throughout the research process meaningful community partnerships to foster the development of feasible and acceptable approaches as well as acceptance, uptake, and sustainability of proposed interventions and strategies. Community partners can include, but are not limited to, those in the housing, transportation, food system, economic development, education, social services, and criminal legal system sectors. Applicants should provide details on the nature and extent of the partnerships by clearly describing the roles of partners and providing evidence of support from partners.</p><p><strong>Prospective Interventions to Address SDOH</strong> may develop and test the effectiveness of new or adapted interventions in a variety of settings in the U.S., such as neighborhoods, community-based organizations, child welfare and human service settings, workplaces, businesses, stores and restaurants, schools, criminal justice settings, faith-based organizations, public works and facilities, healthcare systems, and recreational settings. Approaches may include group or cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), stepped wedge RCT, stepped wedge group or cluster RCT, pragmatic RCT, pragmatic trials, adaptive designs (e.g., multiphase optimization strategy [MOST], sequential multiple assignment randomized trials [SMART]), implementation trials (including hybrid effectiveness/implementation designs), and rigorous quasi-experimental designs.</p><p>Examples of projects supported in this category include, but are not limited to, studies that develop and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions at <i>community-, systems-, and/or population levels</i> to improve health or reduce health disparities by:</p><ul><li>Improving community conditions through community revitalization investment projects</li><li>Improving economic stability, such as through increased job opportunities or quality employment</li><li>Improving housing access, quality, or affordability</li><li>Improving education quality and school environments</li><li>Reducing community-level violence, including firearm violence</li><li>Improving the availability or quality of green spaces or recreational spaces</li><li>Improving community childcare availability together with providing access to parental support groups</li><li>Improving nutritious food availability in the community in addition to providing primary care-based nutritional counseling to individuals</li></ul><p><strong>Evaluation of Existing or Upcoming Interventions</strong> may examine policies, programs, system changes, or environmental changes that are existing or upcoming in the U.S. to address SDOH (structural factors or conditions of daily life <i>at the community-, systems-, and/or population levels</i>) (regardless of NIH funding) by states/territories, cities, counties, tribal communities, healthcare systems, public health departments, school systems, employers, or other organizations. Projects including multiple sites, locations, or settings are strongly encouraged to allow for the analysis of variability across and within settings. Studies that compare outcomes across populations in the U.S. with other countries are also allowed, if the comparison elucidates intervention mechanisms to reduce health disparities in the U.S. In addition to examination of individual level impacts as primary outcomes, examination of secondary outcomes that address unintended consequences of a policy or program, degree of implementation (including acceptance, uptake, spread, and sustainability), and implementation barriers and facilitators, are strongly encouraged.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of projects supported in this category include, but are not limited to studies that evaluate impacts on health and health disparities of:</p><ul><li>Federal, tribal, state, local, or organizational demonstration projects aimed at addressing SDOH</li><li>Tribal policies or programs aimed to address SDOH among American Indian/Alaska Native populations</li><li>New standards of care, changes in health insurance coverage, expansion of access to social services, and other factors that influence SDOH</li><li>Programs or policies designed to improve access, quality, or affordability of housing, transportation, education, and food on health within communities</li><li>Infrastructure changes related to housing, transportation, the food environment, or the built environment</li><li>Programs, policies, or environmental changes targeting SDOH in addition to factors targeting individual or family circumstances such as housing instability, transportation access, nutrition insecurity</li><li>Community economic development policy or program in addition to job training for individuals</li><li>Program or policy to increase community availability of affordable housing, while also implementing screening and referrals for housing insecurity in healthcare settings</li></ul><p><strong>Study Designs:</strong> Randomization may not be possible for all intervention studies, e.g., where it is not possible to assign participants to high versus low discrimination conditions or in small sample sizes where cross intervention contamination is likely to occur or be a problem. Alternative rigorous research designs that provide robust evidence of intervention effectiveness include quasi-experimental designs, such as multiple baseline or repeated measures design or interrupted time series design. Also, hybrid effectiveness-implementation designs allow observational investigation of implementation processes while also testing intervention effectiveness. Investigators should justify their research and analytic design selection and provide adequate evidence of their ability to execute a rigorous and appropriate analysis of randomized or non-randomized study data.</p><p><strong>Non-Responsive Applications</strong><br>The following types of studies will be considered non-responsive for this announcement and will not be reviewed:</p><ul><li>Projects that do not examine an intervention that addresses one or more SDOH as conceptualized as structural factors and conditions of daily life. Projects that intervene solely at the individual or family level will not be considered responsive to this funding opportunity.</li><li>Projects that do not focus on one or more NIH-designated populations that experience health disparities in the US.</li><li>Projects that do not include a community partnership.</li>

Applications that propose to use grant funds to support construction or major alteration and renovation projects will be considered non-responsive.</li></ul><p><strong>Areas of Interest of Participating Institutes, Centers, and Offices (ICOs)</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">NIEHS&#146; mission is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives and has long worked to reduce <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/translational/justice">environmental health disparities and promote environmental justice</a>. NIEHS is interested in innovative intervention research that addresses the interaction of SDOH with chemical and other environmental exposures that compromise health and contribute to health disparities. &nbsp;Examples of environmental exposures which are considered of primary interest for NIEHS include but are not limited to: industrial chemicals or manufacturing byproducts, metals, pesticides, herbicides, air pollutants and other inhaled toxicants, particulates, or fibers, fungal, and bacterial or biologically derived toxins. Applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to the Scientific Contact in the NOFO to discuss if the application fits the NIEHS mission. Applications responsive to NIEHS are required to clearly identify the environmental exposure(s) of interest and describe the intersection of the exposure(s) with SDOH. &nbsp;The use of a conceptual model demonstrating the relationship of SDOH with the environmental exposure(s) of interest is highly encouraged. While the Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and Advance Health Equity initiative supports the evaluation of existing or upcoming interventions, NIEHS is particularly interested in: 1) prospective interventions that develop and test interventions addressing the intersection of social and environmental determinants of health at multiple levels and 2) implementation research (including hybrid effectiveness-implementation studies) focused on strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based interventions that eliminate environmental health disparities and advance environmental health equity. For applications proposing prospective interventions and implementation research, the use of implementation science frameworks is strongly suggested to promote acceptability, scalability, and sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Office of Disease Prevention (ODP)</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">The ODP is the lead office at the NIH responsible for assessing, facilitating, and stimulating research in disease prevention. In partnership with the 27 NIH Institutes and Centers, the ODP strives to increase the scope, quality, dissemination, and impact of NIH-supported prevention research. The ODP is interested in providing co-funding support for research that has strong implications for disease and injury prevention and health equity and that include innovative and appropriate research design, measurement, and analysis methods. For this RFA, ODP is interested in multi-site and/or multi-sectoral interventions that address common risk factors for morbidity and mortality among populations that experience health disparities, including tobacco use, overweight/obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol misuse, drug misuse, risky sexual behavior, injury and violence, infectious disease, and environmental health.

			 <p><strong>Applicant Organizations</strong></p>

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply- Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>

The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code.

	<ul>
		<li><a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11176">NATO Commercial and Government Entity (NCAGE) Code</a> &ndash; Foreign organizations must obtain an NCAGE code (in lieu of a CAGE code) in order to register in SAM.</li>

<p><strong>Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PD(s)/PI(s))</strong></p>

<p>All PD(s)/PI(s) must have an eRA Commons account. &nbsp;PD(s)/PI(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in eRA Commons. If the PD/PI is also the organizational Signing Official, they must have two distinct eRA Commons accounts, one for each role. Obtaining an eRA Commons account can take up to 2 weeks.</p>

Does the proposed research meaningfully address SDOH &ndash; alone or in combination with other factors? What are the most innovative aspects of your application? If successful, what impact would the research have on reducing health disparities and advancing health equity?</p><p>What is the fundamental new insight that is motivating the proposed research? What is the underlying logic or rationale that provides support for pursuing this insight despite little or no preliminary data?</p><p><strong>Research Strategy:</strong> In addition to the instructions in the Application Guide, please consider the following when developing your Research Strategy:</p><p><i>Significance</i>: Describe the SDOH and population experiencing health disparities that the research will address. Also describe why and how the proposed research is important to advancing health equity. Describe briefly the innovative aspects of the proposed research that illuminate its transformative potential. Describe why the proposed research is well suited to the goals of the Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and Advance Health Equity funding opportunity.</p><p><i>Innovation</i>: Describe how your proposed research is unusually innovative and transformative compared to current approaches, paradigms, practices, or perspectives.</p><p><i>Approach</i>: Though preliminary data are not required, if preliminary data are provided, they will be evaluated. In addition to providing details regarding overall strategy, methodology, and analyses, describe the underlying logic or rationale for pursuing this project in the manner proposed. Summarize what you believe to be the major challenges or risks in the project and alternate approaches that may need to be pursued. Describe your approach for ensuring meaningful engagement with relevant community partners.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Timeline</i>: The Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and Advance Health Equity project must be designed to have deliverables by the end of the project period that have the potential for transformative impact. The project should not be framed as initiating a line of research that will have the potential for transformative impact only after subsequent periods of support. Provide a timeline within the project period for the proposed research indicating points where intermediate objectives will be assessed, the measurable outcomes that will be used to monitor progress, and the timing and process for reaching decisions regarding the course and direction of the continuing research effort. Given the high degree of risk involved in applications submitted under the Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and Advance Health Equity program, it is anticipated that investigators will need to continually reassess approaches based on intervention outcomes and potentially alter course to meet project goals. Possible alternative paths that may be followed at critical junctures in the project plan should be indicated on the timeline.</p>

Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH's purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or adopt a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below.</p><p><strong>The PD(s)/PI(s) will have primary responsibility for:</strong></p><ul><li>Providing scientific leadership for all aspects of the study, including planning, any modification of study design, the conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, dissemination of data, tools, and technologies, and collaboration with other investigators.</li><li>Agreeing to accept close coordination, cooperation, and participation of NIH staff in those aspects of scientific and technical management of the study as stated in these terms and conditions.</li><li>Finalizing study design milestones, including a robust statistical plan for analysis, with NIH staff.</li><li>Upon implementation of the study, following the procedures required by the agreed-upon study design regarding study conduct and monitoring, participant management, data collection, quality control, and statistical analysis.</li><li>Providing summaries of progress toward goals and milestones at least yearly, as requested by NIH. The milestones will be reviewed annually (and at other times, if necessary), and new milestones will be negotiated, as needed by working with the NIH staff as appropriate.</li><li>Retaining custody of and having primary rights to the data developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current HHS, PHS, and NIH policies.</li><li>Managing involvement of industry or any other third party in the study. Except for licensing of patents or copyrights, support or involvement of any third party will occur only following notification of and concurrence by the NIH.</li><li>Making all study materials, procedure manuals, and final datasets available in the public domain, managed by the recipient institution. Recipients are expected to publish and publicly disseminate results, data, and other products of the study, concordant with NIH governance policies and protocols. Publications and oral presentations of work performed under this agreement will require appropriate acknowledgment of support by the NIH and the awarding IC.</li><li>Obtaining prior written approval of the awarding IC Grants Management Specialist, in consultation with the Program Officer and Project Scientist, for changes in any of the key personnel identified in the Notice of Grant Award.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below.</strong></p><p><strong>The NIH Project Scientist will:</strong></p><ul><li>Consult with the PD(s)/PI(s) regarding study design milestones prior to finalizing the study design and as needed thereafter.</li><li>Serve as a resource to provide scientific/programmatic support by providing input on experimental and clinical approaches and study protocols, and advising in the management and operational aspects of study development and implementation.</li><li>Provide scientific and programmatic support to the PD(s)/PI(s) as the Project Scientist deems necessary, including contributing to data analysis, key personnel selection, and promoting the availability of data and resources.</li><li>Participate in teleconferences or other discussions with PDs/PIs to monitor study development and implementation progress, adherence to the study protocol, the conduct of the study, and recruitment and retention of study participants.</li><li>Review the progress of the study through consideration of routine reporting, site visits, oversight committee recommendations, etc. This review may include, but not be limited to, compliance with the study protocol, achievement of participant enrollment targets, and the timeliness and quality of data reporting.</li><li>Periodically review reports of study progress. NIH staff may use information obtained from the data for the preparation of internal reports on the activities of the study.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The Project Scientist will not make decisions about the funding of this project and will not be involved in any special reviews of the project that make recommendations about funding.</p><p><strong>The NIH Program Official will:</strong></p><ul><li>Carry out a continuous review of all activities to ensure that the objectives are being met and that all regulatory, fiscal, and administrative matters are handled according to NIH and IC guidelines.</li><li>Have the option to withhold support to a participating institution if technical performance requirements/milestones are not met.</li><li>Conduct special reviews of the project as the Program Official deems necessary. NIH may engage outside experts to assist in these reviews. If concerns about the project arise and are not resolved, NIH may reduce or restrict the budget or reduce the term of support to phase out the project.</li><li>An agency program official or IC program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the notice of award.</li></ul><p>The NIH reserves the right to terminate or curtail a study or any portion of a project in the event of (a) substantive changes in the project not approved in advance, (b) use of funds for activities not within the scope of the award, (c) failure to make sufficient progress toward the project milestones, (d) failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award or establish necessary statutory, regulatory, policy approval required for conducting the project, or (e) ethical or conflict of interest issues.</p><p><strong>Joint Responsibilities:</strong></p><p>No joint responsibilities. &nbsp;All responsibilities and activities assigned to PI/PDs and NIH staff (PO, SDO, SD) are separate and distinct.</p><p><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong></p><p>Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened.
