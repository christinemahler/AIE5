                <p>The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to renew the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study of HIV in United States Adults (MWCCS) for a 6-year project period (2026-2032). Continuation of this epidemiological study of middle-aged and older people living with HIV (PLWH), along with comparable individuals living without HIV (PLWOH) will enable the continued follow-up of a deeply phenotyped cohort of approximately 5,700 participants from across the United States. This initiative will utilize a populomics approach, i.e., examination of health determinants across multiple scales of influence (e.g. molecular, cellular, physiological, lifestyle/behavioral, household, neighborhood, environmental, cultural, and sociopolitical) using multi-disciplinary methods to investigate the web of influences impacting the health, quality of life, and survival of adults living with HIV.</p><p>This NOFO seeks applications to fund a single Data Analysis and Sharing Center (DASC) for the MWCCS, with competition limited to institutions who were funded under RFA-HL-19-007.</p><p>This NOFO runs in parallel with two companion U01 NOFOs:</p><p><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HL-26-009.html">RFA-HL-26-009</a> (Limited Competition: Clinical Research Sites (CRS) for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (U01 Clinical Trials Not Allowed)) and</p><p><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HL-26-011.html">RFA-HL-26-011</a> (Leadership and Coordination Center (LACC) for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (U01 Clinical Trials Not Allowed))</p>

Yet despite these advancements, today over 38 million people are living with HIV worldwide, with approximately 1.2 million new cases being diagnosed annually worldwide. In the United States, HIV incidence rates have declined, but scientific and public health advances have not benefited all populations evenly, with disproportionate negative impact of HIV on racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities, people with limited socioeconomic resources, and rural populations.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">There have been significant improvements in both viral suppression rates among people living with HIV and the number of HIV-negative people prescribed HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the past ten years. According to CDC data, in 2019, 66% of people with diagnosed HIV in the U.S. were virally suppressed because of treatment with highly effective antiretroviral therapies (ART), an increase from 60% in 2015. Additionally, in 2019 nearly a quarter (23%) of people who could benefit from PrEP received prescriptions, an increase from 3% in 2015.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">With the development of effective ART medications and wide access to them in the U.S., HIV infection has become a chronic disease, and PLWH are now surviving longer, aging, and requiring lifelong care and treatment. Currently in the United States, over 50% of PLWH are aged 50 and older, many of whom have been living with HIV for many years. At the same time, some people become infected with HIV later in life and need diagnosis and initial treatment at older ages. Across all age groups, PLWH are at increased risk of developing chronic comorbidities, coinfections, and complications, including noncommunicable diseases, as well as mental health and substance use disorders, even when HIV is suppressed.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Due to persistent viral reservoirs, inflammation caused by the virus, long-term use of ART, polypharmacy, and other pathological mechanisms that are not yet well-understood, older PLWH are at increased risk for multiple comorbidities. These comorbidities include cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, hematological disease, sleep disorders, malignancies, diabetes, mental disorders, sensory disorders, liver disease, cognitive impairment, and central nervous system complications. In addition, periodontal disease, alcoholism, and drug abuse are prevalent health issues among PLWH. Even with effective ART, many PLWH experience accelerated aging, altered metabolism, and chronic immunopathogenesis factors that converge and contribute to the development of several comorbidities and end-organ diseases.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Given the adverse trends in HIV-related health disparities and the growing numbers of older adults living with HIV, there is a continuing urgent need for basic, clinical, epidemiologic, behavioral, and translational research to understand the pathophysiology and treatment of HIV infection and its associated complications and comorbidities. This populomics approach can directly contribute to the scientific knowledge needed to develop, test, implement, and scale up multilevel, intersectional culturally-appropriate, community-engaged interventions, clinical practices, and guidelines to address the social and structural determinants of health and reduce disparities in HIV-related morbidity and mortality.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Project Origins</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) is one of the world&#146;s longest running cohort studies focused on the short and long-term effects of HIV. Since its inception, the MWCCS has yielded important findings to inform clinical practice and health policy including improvements in uptake and adherence to ART leading to reductions in morbidity and mortality for PLWH.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) of men was established in 1983 and the Women&#146;s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) began enrollment in 1994. In 2019, recognizing the evolving burden of HIV among aging populations, the NIH merged the MACS and WIHS to form the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) with primary program leadership by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and co-funding and scientific guidance provided by 14 additional ICOs of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Using a cooperative agreement mechanism, 13 clinical research sites (CRS) and a data analysis and coordination center (DACC) were funded for a 7-year project period in 2019, ending in 2026.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">MWCCS is a deeply phenotyped and richly diverse cohort comprised of both PLWH and sociodemographically similar PLWOH. Women comprise half of the cohort, and more than 75% of participants recruited since 2019 are Black or Hispanic individuals, among whom HIV incidence rates are elevated compared with non-Hispanic whites. MWCCS includes the largest and longest running cohort of women living with HIV in the United States and is an exemplar of the priorities of the new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/womenshealthresearch/">White House Initiative on Women&#146;s Health Research</a>. With over 12,000 ever-enrolled study participants over a 40-year period, MWCCS has contributed significantly to our understanding of the pathogenesis and virology of HIV disease, and continues to address the psychosocial, socioeconomic, structural and behavioral factors that drive the HIV epidemic in the U.S.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Phenotyping in MWCCS is both comprehensive and frequent, with annual study visits that include clinical exams, labs, and interviews. The biorepository contains about 5.4 million specimens, and there is a robust -omics research program including substudies and linked NIH grants focused on proteomics, DNA methylome, and microbiome, and other factors associated with a number of comorbidites and with mortality. Scientific productivity of the MWCCS has remained high since the cohort merger in 2019, with about 500 scientific publications since 2019, many in high impact journals, and currently over 100 active ancillary studies. NIH-funded ancillary studies include 30 active training awards.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Purpose and Organization of the MWCCS Renewal</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Purpose:</u></strong> The purpose of this NOFO and its two companion NOFOs is to renew the MWCCS for a 6-year project period (2026-2032). Continuation of this epidemiological study of middle-aged and older PLWH, along with comparable PLWOH, will enable the sustained follow-up of a deeply phenotyped cohort of approximately 5,700 participants from across the United States. This initiative will utilize a populomics approach, i.e., examination of health determinants across multiple scales of influence (e.g. molecular, cellular, physiological, lifestyle/behavioral, household, neighborhood, environmental, cultural, and sociopolitical) using multi-disciplinary methods to investigate the web of influences impacting the health, quality of life, and survival of adults living with HIV.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Renewal of the MWCCS aligns with the <a href="https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/strategic-plan">NIH Strategic Plan for HIV and HIV-Related Research</a> and the White House initiative &#147;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/01/fact-sheet-the-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administrations-efforts-to-end-hiv-aids-at-home-and-abroad/">Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE): A Plan for America</a>&#148;, which provide a roadmap for the NIH HIV/AIDS research program, ensuring that funds are allocated per established NIH scientific research priorities. Aligned with these goals, the MWCCS will continue to serve as a reliable, valid and standardized platform for collaborative and independently-funded HIV populomics research for both MWCCS investigators and the broader scientific research community.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Organization:</u> </strong>For the renewal period (2026-2032), there will be 3 highly integrated, collaborative, and cooperative components to the MWCCS, each funded via a distinct award mechanism:</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Leadership and Coordination Center (LACC):</strong> NIH intends to fund a single LACC via an open competition. The purpose of the new LACC will be to improve clinical guidance and oversight of the cohort and create an enhanced structure for scientific leadership, scientific work group support, participant outcomes ascertainment, internal training, operational accountability, community and participant engagement, and promotion of the cohort to external stakeholders. Additional information about the LACC can be found in the companion NOFO <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HL-26-011.html">RFA-HL-26-011</a> (Leadership and Coordination Center (LACC) for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (U01 Clinical Trials Not Allowed)).</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Clinical Research Sites (CRS):</strong> NIH intends to renew funding via a limited competition NOFO for up to 13 clinical research sites. Each CRS will be expected to retain cohort enrollment of all MWCCS participants who gave informed consent during the period 2019-2025 and continue to track and solicit participation from any remaining MACS or WIHS participants who have neither declined nor agreed to enroll in the MWCCS. In addition, the 5 CRS whose investigators participated in the STAR Cohort of HIV in Reproductive Age Women have the option to invite STAR cohort participants (only those who meet all inclusion criteria for MWCCS) to join the MWCCS. Inclusion of STAR participants in MWCCS is not a required activity, and NIH encourages applicants to carefully consider their CRS resources and scientific priorities before making a decision. If a CRS does choose to solicit enrollment of eligible STAR Cohort participants, NIH expects that the consent process would involve transfer and integration of all STAR data and biospecimens for those participants to the MWCCS archive and biorepository. Additional information about the CRS can be found in the companion NOFO <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HL-26-009.html">RFA-HL-26-009</a> (Limited Competition: Clinical Research Sites (CRS) for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (U01 Clinical Trials Not Allowed)).</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Data Analysis and Sharing Center (DASC):&nbsp;</strong>NIH intends to fund a redefined MWCCS Data Analysis and Sharing Center (DASC) via this limited competition NOFO. The DASC will prioritize systems modernization, more rapid and accessible data sharing, and enhanced biostatistical support to investigators and scientific working groups, while coordinating, standardizing, and integrating all core data collection, processing, storage, and analytic activities of the cohort. The DASC will also serve as a resource to the scientific community to enable and promote broad use of the MWCCS data to advance HIV populomics science. NIH expects applicants for the DASC to include, but not be limited to, the following areas of responsibility in their proposal:</p><ol><li>Systems Modernization</li><li>Data Security</li><li>Data Management and Sharing</li><li>Data Dissemination and Training</li><li>Biospecimens Protection</li><li>Cohort Multisite Collaboration Plan</li><li>Program Monitoring, Evaluation, and Quality Control</li><li>Analytical Innovations</li></ol><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Scientific Priority Areas</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The MWCCS renewal initiative will support activities under two broad umbrellas: (1) continuation of the MWCCS as a cohort study platform that will collect and make publicly available high-quality risk factor and outcome data on HIV and associated comorbidities in middle-aged and older adults in the United States; and (2) investigations of highly significant scientific research questions that are of interest to the MWCCS investigators and which are well-aligned with the scientific priorities of the co-funding NIH ICOs.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">In the table below, NIH <i><strong>platform priorities</strong></i> (i.e. priorities for new or continued data collection) and<i><strong> investigational priorities</strong></i> (i.e. priority topics and questions for analysis, publication, and dissemination) are listed by co-funding ICO. Many ICO scientific priorities may be both overlapping and complementary, and applicants are advised that duplicative priorities are not always listed in the table in the interest of brevity. Specific areas of HIV populomics science which will be supported by the initiative include but are not limited to:</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>TABLE OF NIH SCIENTIFIC PRIORITIES FOR THE MWCCS RENEWAL</strong></p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Funding Institute, Center, Office</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Cohort Study Platform Priorities</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><i>(priorities for new or continued data collection)</i></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Scientific Investigational Priorities</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><i>(priority topics for analysis, publication, and dissemination)</i></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">Heart, Lung, and Blood (NHLBI)</p></td><td><ul><li>Continued collection of core data:<ul><li>Cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary, and sleep risk factor data for all cohort participants.</li><li>Clinical measurements of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and sleep system status and function.</li></ul></li><li>Expanded collection of additional risk factor data relevant to NHLBI priorities (e.g. diet and nutritional status, physical activity and sedentary behavior, social determinants of health, occupational and environmental exposures, biomarkers and -omics).</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Comparison of incidence and short-term and long-term outcomes of cardiometabolic, neurovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and sleep comorbidities between PLWH and PLWOH.</li><li>Impact of HIV infection, treatments, and quality of healthcare on progression of cardiometabolic, neurovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and sleep disorders in people aging with treated HIV.</li><li>Effects of having multiple chronic conditions and the use of multiple medications on health outcomes in aging PLWH.</li><li>The role of chronic inflammation and immune activation in the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in PLWH.</li><li>Role of HIV viral co-infections (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, EBV, CMS,&nbsp;emerging pathogens) in the development of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders</li><li>Biological mechanisms underlying accelerated aging in PLWH, including cellular senescence, telomere shortening, and mitochondrial dysfunction.</li><li>Factors that contribute to resilience and better health outcomes in PLWH, including biological, behavioral, socioeconomic, and environmental factors.</li><li>Patterns of healthcare access and utilization, and their impact on disease management and outcomes in PLWH.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</p></td><td><ul><li>HIV virology and immunology measures, seroconverstion among PLWOH, HIV reservoir</li><li>Co-infections (e.g. HBV, HCV, CMV, SARS-CoV-2, HPV, emerging pathogens)</li><li>Chronic immune activation, inflammatory pathogenesis</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Predictors of emergent HIV drug resistance</li><li>Basic science of immune activation and inflammatory pathogenesis in PLWH</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">Mental Health (NIMH)</p></td><td><ul><li>Collection of new follow-up DSM-5 diagnostic data from select cohort participants using the World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO WMH-CIDI).</li><li>Maintain ongoing collection of self-reported data on mental health, behavioral health, and social determinants of health</li><li>Continued collection of harmonized neuro-medical, neurobehavioral assessments and measures of neuroimmune dysregulation across all study sites, in addition to Brain-baseline Assessment of Cognition and Everyday Function (Brace +) and CAT-MH, ensuring: a.

NIH expects the JUMP to employ an alternating modular design which will result in a shortening of each annual visit in terms of duration and effort for the participants, while creating time and opportunity to address current data gaps through collection of new data on multiple risk factors and outcomes of scientific importance.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Implementing biennial and/or triennial content modules while maintaining a much briefer core annual exam (needed for blood draws and outcomes ascertainment) will help address and reconcile 3 important competing priorities: (1) contain the time and effort burden on aging participants with significant vulnerabilities; (2) expand data collection to cover important data gaps across multiple areas of HIV comorbidity science; (3) increase the number of participants who complete high-intensity data modules such as cardiac echocardiography, pulmonary function tests, and sleep actigraphy. In addition the JUMP plan will create time and opportunity for the future addition of ancillary-funded modules, without overburdening study participants.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Finalization of the JUMP will not occur until after the MWCCS renewal cooperative agreement awards are made in early 2026. The first six months of the new grant period will be used by the new LACC leadership, in coordination with the Executive Committee, the DASC, and NIH Project Scientists and Collaborators, to review and finalize a consensus version of the JUMP. Therefore, in addition to content details of their proposed JUMP, LACC applicants should explain and justify the relevant principles, scientific priorities, and consensus process they have employed for developing the JUMP. CRS award recipients and the DASC recipient will be expected to fully participate and cooperate with the JUMP finalization process which will be led and coordinated by the team which is awarded the LACC cooperative agreement. A detailed proposed JUMP should be included in the applications for the LACC cooperative agreement, but not in the CRS or DASC applications.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Example of a JUMP modular design</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">One example of a possible JUMP protocol design is shown in the Table below. In this example, there are two non-overlapping biennial modules (B and C, collected every 2 years), three non-overlapping triennial modules (D, E, and F, collected every three years), and one annual module of essential core data items (module A, collected every year). Under the requested 6-year grant period, the investigators would be able to complete five annual study visits (V107-V111) in five years (Oct 2026-Sep 2031). This example JUMP plan would permit collection of module A five times, module B three times, and modules C, D, and E twice. Module F would be collected once during V109.&nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Apr 2026-Sep 2026</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>6 months</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Oct 2026 &ndash;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Sep 2027</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>12 months</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Oct 2027 &ndash;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Sep 2028</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>12 months</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Oct 2028 &ndash;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Sep 2029</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>12 months</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Oct 2029 &ndash;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Sep 2030</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>12 months</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Oct 2030 &ndash;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Sep 2031</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>12 months</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Oct 2031 &ndash;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Mar 2032</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>6 months</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>MWCCS Visit</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">V106</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">V107</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">V108</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">V109</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">V110</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">V111</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">None</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Annual core</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">current protocol</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">A</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">A</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">A</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">A</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">A</p></td><td rowspan="4"><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">Completion of scientific, data sharing, and cohort close-out activities</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Biennial modules</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">NA</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">B</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">C</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">B</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">C</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">B</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Triennial modules</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">NA</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">D</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">E</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">F</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">D</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">E</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;"><strong>Ancillary-funded modules</strong></p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">NA</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">TBD</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">TBD</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">TBD</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">TBD</p></td><td><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;">TBD</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p style="margin-left:0in;">The specific scientific data content of all of the proposed modules in the JUMP should reflect both the scientific priorities of the co-funding NIH ICOs (see Table of NIH Scientific Priorities above), as well as be well-aligned with the scientific expertise of the study investigators and the research priorities and investigational specific aims of each CRS applicant.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The example JUMP timeline above is for illustrative purposes only, and the LACC applicants are expected to weigh all contributing factors in proposing and justifying the frequency of data collection for each proposed content module. However, a proposed JUMP protocol in which the majority of content modules are scheduled to be collected on an annual basis will be considered non-responsive to the requirements of the LACC NOFO.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Limitations and Requirements</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Cohort Participants</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The following groups of individuals are eligible cohort participants for the renewal period:</p><ol><li>Persons who were ever enrolled in the MWCCS from 2020 to 2025.</li><li>Persons who were ever enrolled in the original MACS or WIHS cohorts and who completed at least one in-person study visit prior to 2019.</li><li>Women who were ever enrolled in the STAR cohort (via study sites funded under <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-19-024.html">RFA-HD-19-024</a>) <u>and</u> who meet <u>all</u>&nbsp;current eligibility criteria for enrollment in the MWCCS. Recruitment and enrollment of former STAR cohort participants is an optional activity which is not a requirement for any applicant.</li></ol><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Annual Visits</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The MWCCS Renewal will not provide support for semi-annual participant clinic visits for the purposes of data collection. NIH expects all core-funded data collection to occur during the annual visits, beginning with V107 in the fall of 2026.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">However, CRS applicants may choose to propose and budget for more frequent participant contacts for the purposes of ensuring participant retention, engagement, education, and/or safety and well-being. Similarly, NIH anticipates that future ancillary-funded data collection modules could be timed to either coincide with the core-funded annual visit, or alternatively to occur at a 6-month visit or other time point.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Special Considerations</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong><u>Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research</u></strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Many NIH ICs encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a "Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal" (<a href="http://cde.nih.gov/">http://cde.nih.gov/</a>) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects NIH ICs strongly encourages investigators that plan to collect phenotype and/or environmental exposure data about their study participants to utilize standard protocols included in the PhenX Toolkit (<a href="http://www.phenxtoolkit.org" Title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">http://www.phenxtoolkit.org</a>).</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Limited Competition</u></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">This NOFO is limited to institutions funded under <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HL-19-007.html">RFA-HL-19-007</a> and will fund a single Data Analysis and Sharing Center (DASC) for the MWCCS.</p>

Therefore, the Research Strategy section of the proposal should not repeat language from the technical attachments, but rather should be written for a broadly multidisciplinary audience of peer reviewers and NIH program staff.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Data Systems and Data Collection:</u> Include justifications, timelines, and specific plans (avoiding technical intricacies which should be included in the supplements as needed) for essential core activities related to (1) modernization and major improvements in Gemini or conversion to a cloud-based system (e.g. RedCap), (2) data security (including encryption, secure data transfer protocols, remote work and access control, ongoing cohort-wide staff training and credentialing, security audits, and security incident management and reporting), contingency plans for likely problem scenarios, and (3) other information as deemed appropriate by the applicants.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Data Processing, Quality Control, Archiving, and Biospecimens Protections:</u> Describe planned improvements and enhanced efficiencies for these core activities, in the context of the new JUMP annual visits which will commence in October 2026. Include plans for training CRS staff and investigators on key issues and responsibilities. CRS applicants have been instructed to budget funds for in-person staff trainings at the DASC as needed. In addition to in-person trainings, innovative and complementary training modalities may be proposed (e.g. establishment of training manuals, a perpetual video training library, help-desk office hours, live zoom training webinars, etc).</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Collaborations and Communications:</u> Establish plans to work collaboratively and communicate effectively with the LACC, the CRS, scientific and operational working groups, NIH staff, and outside investigators. Describe and justify any new or continuing operational working groups that will provide critical advising and oversight to the DASC for key areas of responsibility.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Data Dissemination and Training</u>: At least one public data release annually for the length of the award is mandatory. Annual MWCCS data releases should employ the NHLBI-recommended <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/data-sharing-policy-faq-data-freeze-approach">Data Freeze Approach.</a> Each annual public data release should be accompanied by comprehensive and end-user friendly data dictionaries and codebooks (supported by standardized vocabulary mapping and metadata) which are accessible to outside investigators as well as MWCCS investigators and staff. Describe new and innovative strategies planned to provide training (at multiple levels of technical expertise) to MWCCS investigators and staff and outside investigators (including ESIs and trainees) and ongoing technical support for the duration of the project period. Leveraging of available NHLBI tools, such as BioData Catalyst, is recommended.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Program Evaluation</u>: Describe plans (including frequency and timelines) to evaluate internal cohort progress toward meeting operational and scientific specific aims in the arenas of: (1) participant recruitment, engagement, retention, and completion of data collection protocols; (2) completeness and usability of specific data modules which are tied to scientific priority areas; (3) research productivity of MWCCS scientific working groups and investigators; (4) effectiveness of the operational working groups in ensuring quality control and high fidelity adherence to the JUMP by all MWCCS staff and investigators.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Analytic Leadership and Innovations</u>: Provide a comprehensive data analytic strategy which addresses important methodological, statistical, and data science issues relevant to the MWCCS cohort. Relevant analytic topics include but may not be limited to:</p><ul><li>Statistical approaches to, and empirical justifications for, parsimonious data redaction and masking in all publicly released data files with the goal of ensuring protection of participant identities while minimizing negative impacts on data usability.</li><li>Analytic approaches to etiologic research which investigates multilevel influences on HIV comorbidities and outcomes (e.g. biological, individual, familial, neighborhood, region).</li><li>Statistical approaches to non-response bias, missing data over multiple cohort visits and multiple data domains, and participant mortality and loss-to-follow-up.</li><li>Rigorous analytic strategies to compensate for any non-comparability of study groups in analyses which compare PLWH and PLWOH.</li><li>Innovations in data visualizations for both internal (operational) and external (public data dissemination) purposes.</li><li>Innovations in longitudinal cohort outcomes analytic techniques.</li><li>Innovations in training and dissemination such as the use of scientific analysis notebooks (e.g. Jupyter Notebooks, Google Collab) to provide step-by-step analytic approaches.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;">This section should also include justification for any DASC-supported co-investigators and discussion of how they will support MWCCS investigators and staff with data analyses, data visualizations, and co-authoring of concept sheets and scientific publications.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220533' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>All applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by NIH) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the Data Management and Sharing Plan. All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Management and Sharing Plan.</p><p>Additionally, applicants should consult and incorporate the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/nhlbi-policy-for-data-sharing">NHLBI Supplement to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing</a> into their DMSP as applicable. This includes, but is not limited to, plans to share scientific data through existing NIH-supported Scientific Data Repositories, Ancillary Studies, and the Data Freeze Approach.</p><p><strong><u>Data Repositories</u></strong></p><p>NHLBI-supported researchers are expected to share scientific data through existing NIH-supported Scientific Data Repositories or other repositories that have the desired characteristics described in the Supplemental Information to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing: Selecting a Repository for Data Resulting from NIH-Supported Research. NHLBI encourages submission of data into NHLBI BioData Catalyst (BDC), especially for data from studies that must comply with NHLBI&#146;s Accrual of Human Subjects (Milestones) Policy and for those projects supported by funding opportunity announcements that encourage data deposition into BDC. NHLBI also encourages the submission of data into BDC for NHLBI projects and ancillary studies to NHLBI parent studies subject to the NIH GDS Policy. For data submitted to repositories other than BDC, an appropriate globally-unique, persistent identifier with sufficient metadata should be shared with NHLBI to promote FAIR principles and populate a master index for data generated from all NHLBI-supported research.</p><p>NHLBI discourages the deposition of data in multiple places, which may incur issues of version control and excess storage costs. If researchers need to deposit data generated from NHLBI support into more than one repository, the rationale for this need should be provided within the Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines element in DMS Plans. When approved for deposition in multiple repositories by appropriate NHLBI staff, for data deposited in repositories other than BDC, an appropriate globally-unique, persistent identifier for each repository, with sufficient metadata, should be provided to the NHLBI to promote FAIR principles.</p><p><strong><u>Ancillary Studies</u></strong></p><p>NHLBI defines ancillary studies as studies that collect new data or derive data for purposes that are separate from the main &#147;parent&#148; study. The goal of ancillary studies is to extend scientific knowledge beyond the parent study&#146;s original scope. NHLBI ancillary studies are primarily supported by NIH funds but may also be funded, in part or whole, by other sources such as non-profit and private sector organizations. Studies approved as ancillary, regardless of funding sources, to an NHLBI-funded parent observational study or clinical trial (including studies co-funded by multiple institutes, centers, and offices or to which NHLBI provides administrative oversight) are required to adhere to the parent study&#146;s data sharing policies as a condition of approval. The requirements of data sharing agreements between NHLBI-funded parents and their ancillary studies should be consistent with the principles of the NIH DMS Policy.</p><p>Data sharing requirements are outlined in the agreement between the parent and respective ancillary study, and it is the responsibility of the ancillary study principal investigator to state in writing to the parent study steering committee any special circumstances that would preclude or limit data sharing. As specified in contract terms or award terms, designees from the parent studies shall submit updated and new ancillary data to an NHLBI-approved data repository on the same data submission timeline as the parent data (for example, core exam data, annual event surveillance, etc.). Ancillary study principal investigators should get advance approval from the parent study steering committee for any plans to share data with other repositories which have characteristics consistent with those described in the Supplemental Information to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing: Selecting a Repository for Data Resulting from NIH-Supported Research.</p><p><strong><u>Data Freeze Approach</u></strong></p><p>To maximize the value of data sharing with the biomedical research community and control study and repository costs, NHLBI allows Institute-supported studies to use a comprehensive data freeze approach to meet NIH Data Management and Sharing policy requirements. This approach requires sharing comprehensive data freezes of scientific data throughout the funded project periods in advance of publications rather than sharing small subsets of extensive data on a per-publication basis. For more information on the Data Freeze Approach, see the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/data-sharing-policy-faq-data-freeze-approach">FAQ page</a></p>

All MWCCS stakeholders will have representation on the EC and participate in sharing decision-making on all topics of broad important to cohort operations. One or more of the LACC mPIs will serve as permanent EC Chair, with an additional EC Chair chosen by the CRS mPIs.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">As an explicit condition of their NIH cooperative agreement awards, all recipients must agree to both actively participate in the EC and to collegially abide by its decisions and policies pertaining to all aspects of study operations.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Specific areas of responsibility for EC members include but may not be limited to:</p><ul><li>Protection of participant safety via regular monitoring and responsive corrective action when needed</li><li>Promotion of scientific integrity, validity, and excellence in all areas of study operations and scientific investigations</li><li>Facilitation of rapid and regular data sharing with the broader scientific community to increase the pace, significance, and impact of MWCCS HIV populomics research.</li><li>Participation in regular EC video calls, annual cohort meetings, and ad-hoc trainings, research meetings, and other gatherings as needed</li><li>Assistance to and support of the NCAB</li><li>Substantive contributions to, and participation in, Scientific Working Groups and Operational Working Groups as appropriate for individual areas of expertise.</li><li>Cooperation and collaboration with the LACC and the DASC on relevant areas of study operations and scientific investigations</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>MWCCS Steering Committee</u></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The SC is a subset of the EC which meets more frequently than the full EC and advises the EC on important operational and scientific issues. All MWCCS stakeholders (CRS mPIs, CRS Project Directors, LACC mPIs, DASC mPIs, NIH Program Staff, NCAB members) should have at least one representative on the SC. The EC Co-Chairs will also serve as SC Co-Chairs.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Scientific Work Groups</u></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">SWGs are comprised of subject-matter scientific experts from the CRS, the LACC, the DASC, and NIH who collaborate on new and continuing scientific investigations which will result in public presentations and peer-reviewed publications. SWGs should also include and provide mentorship opportunities for early-stage investigators, including pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees. The LACC will provide scientific leadership and coordination of operations (e.g. scheduling of meetings, maintenance of records, facilitation of communications), while the DASC will monitor SWG productivity and outputs via monitoring of agreed-upon productivity metrics and regular reporting to the EC. The number and topic areas of the SWG will be determined by the MWCCS investigators (LACC and EC); however NIH expects that these topic areas will be well-aligned with the NIH scientific priority areas detailed in Section 1 of this NOFO. Furthermore, NIH expects that there will be no gaps in coverage &ndash; in other words there should be no NIH priority area which is not covered by at least one SWG.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Operational Work Groups</u></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">OWGs have the purpose of bringing together scientific and methodological experts from among MWCCS investigators and staff, as well as NIH staff as appropriate, to consider and advise the LACC, the DASC, and the EC on topics of significance to cohort operations. For example, a Laboratory Measures Working Group might have the mandate of reviewing and ensuring quality and high-fidelity adherence to study protocol in the collection, processing, storage, and analysis of participant biospecimens. The number and topic areas of the OWGs will be proposed by the LACC and the DASC and agreed to by the EC. Coordination, administrative support, and monitoring of the OWGs will be the responsibility of either the LACC or the DASC, depending on the specific topic area.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>National Community Advisory Board</u></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">MWCCS investigators and staff from the CRS, LACC, and DASC and NIH staff will collaborate to support the NCAB, its members, and its planned activities as requested by NCAB leadership. The LACC will provide leadership and coordination for cohort support of the NCAB, including centralized administration and payment of stipends and travel reimbursements to NCAB members for required annual national meetings.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>Observational Study Monitoring Board</u></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The OSMB is an independent board of scientific, clinical care, and bioethics experts who monitor MWCCS progress and advise the Director of NHLBI on matters of study performance, participant safety, return of clinical results, informed consent, participant burden, and overall study success. All MWCCS stakeholders collaborate to support the OSMB through provision of any requested data or information about study operations and scientific investigations, including making presentations and/or preparing topic-specific reports as requested by the OSMB members.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Violations of Terms and Conditions of Cooperative Agreement Awards</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The NHLBI and NIH reserve the right to withhold funding or curtail the study if any of the following occur:</p><ul><li>Human participant ethical issues that may dictate a premature end of the award</li><li>Substantial shortfall in participant recruitment, follow-up, data reporting, data sharing, or quality control</li><li>Failure to develop or implement a mutually agreeable protocol</li><li>Major breach of the protocol or substantive changes in the agreed-upon protocol, methodologies, and/or tools with which the NHLBI/NIH cannot concur</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and HHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.</p>
