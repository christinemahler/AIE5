Notice of Funding Opportunity Description'}, page_content=\"RFA-AI-24-079: Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research Centers (U19 Clinical Trial Optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n    Purpose\\n    \\n \\n    This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) invites applications from single institutions or consortia of institutions to participate in the Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research Centers (AADCRC) program. The program will support centers that integrate clinical and translational research to conduct studies on the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of diseases of interest, including asthma, rhinitis (allergic and non-allergic), chronic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and drug allergy. The overarching goal of the program is to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions and to provide a rational foundation for new, effective treatments and prevention strategies.\\n    \\n \\n    Background\\n    \\n \\n    Asthma and allergic diseases are major causes of illness and disability in the United States, and the prevalence of these conditions is still on the rise. Also of high prevalence and morbidity are chronic rhinosinusitis and non-allergic rhinitis, which share pathophysiologic and clinical characteristics with allergic airway diseases. In all these conditions, major gaps exist in our understanding of their immunopathophysiology and, for most of them, management is either based on avoidance of allergens or pharmacologic or biologic interventions that offer either only symptomatic relief or have nonspecific anti-inflammatory activities and do not alter the natural history of the disease. Allergen immunotherapy for aeroallergens and perhaps food allergens or early dietary introduction of food allergens offer promise in disease modification and prevention, but require further study.\\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n      Asthma\\n      \\n     affects approximately 8% of the U.S. population, including 5-6 million children, and is one of the major causes of missed school days and hospitalization in children and adolescents. Severe asthma affects 5-10% of all patients with asthma but is responsible for a much higher social and economic burden when compared with mild and moderate disease. Despite advances in understanding asthma endotypes, large gaps remain in determining the immunologic pathways that lead to the inflammatory presentations of severe disease.\\n     \\n \\n \\n      Allergic rhinitis\\n      \\n     is estimated to affect approximately 60 million people in the United States. Large numbers of patients with these conditions do not achieve adequate relief with available medications, resulting in substantial social and economic burdens.\\n     \\n \\n \\n      Non-allergic rhinitis\\n      \\n     affects close to 30 million people and presumably includes a number of distinct syndromes, but no systematic research has been conducted to determine phenotypes and endotypes, a necessary step towards rational development of novel therapeutic approaches.\\n     \\n \\n \\n      Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n      \\n     with or without nasal polyps, which is estimated to affect up to 12% of the U.S. population and results in roughly 15 million physician visits and 200,000 sinus surgical procedures each year, manifests as persistent inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa, is heterogeneous, and remains difficult to manage despite recent advancements with anti-type 2 cytokine monoclonal antibodies. Research to better elucidate endotypes and define the early events in the development of the disease is needed.\\n     \\n \\n \\n      Atopic dermatitis\\n      \\n     affects approximately 20% of infants, 10-12% of children under age 18 and up to 7-8% of adults in the United States. Despite the known scientific associations between atopic dermatitis and allergic disease, the role of allergy in atopic dermatitis and the etiologic and pathophysiologic interactions between atopic dermatitis and food or respiratory allergy are incompletely understood.\\n     \\n \\n \\n      Food allergy\\n      \\n     affects approximately 8% of children and, as recently suggested, 10% of adults. Food allergy is the most frequent cause of emergency department visits for anaphylaxis. The mechanisms of food allergy development are not fully understood and require further investigation. Recent advancements in the prevention of food allergy with early allergen consumption and in the management with anti-IgE and allergen immunotherapy are beneficial, but much remains to be learned regarding the mode of action of these approaches, understanding non- or poor responsiveness to treatment, and developing predictive biomarkers to optimize management. Better biomarkers also are needed for food allergy diagnosis to reduce the need for oral food challenges in research or in the clinic.\\n     \\n \\n \\n      Allergic drug reactions\\n      \\n     are defined for the purpose of this NOFO as reactions that have an immunologic component. These reactions result in excess morbidity, particularly in patients who are in need of the drug in question and have underlying serious conditions. The mechanisms of many allergic drug reactions have not been determined. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of these reactions may facilitate prediction and prevention or may guide the development of drugs with less allergenicity.\\n     \\n \\n \\n    Both innate and adaptive immune responses participate in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. It is well established that environmental exposures in early childhood influence the expression of many of these diseases later in life. These exposures involve not only allergens, but other immunologically active agents that may include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and various environmental substances. Some of these exposures may be protective against allergic disease, but much remains to be learned as to the mechanisms of protection. Interactions of early exposure to these factors plus an individual's genetic makeup shape the development of the immune system and together determine the risk for allergic disease. Recent insights raise the possibility that epigenetic modifications also play a role in controlling the function of the immune system and that these modifications also are influenced by environmental exposures.\\n    \\n \\n    Allergen-specific immunotherapy trials with food and aeroallergens have demonstrated reduced responsiveness to the allergens in question, a protective effect that also can be sustained after discontinuation of treatment. The Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial has shown substantial reduction in the development of peanut allergy with early introduction and maintained exposure of peanut-containing food in high-risk infants. This effect lasts at least into early adolescence. Earlier studies have suggested that allergen immunotherapy in children with allergic rhinitis may prevent the development of asthma. Thus, evidence exists that allergy prevention is possible. However, improvements in allergen immunotherapy are necessary to increase its tolerogenic effectiveness and reduce the duration of treatment while further improving its safety profile and usability. In addition, new forms of immunotherapy are under development and require testing.\\n    \\n \\n    The NIAID AADCRC program, established over 5 decades ago as the first targeted research program in the field of asthma and allergic diseases, is the cornerstone of NIAID's efforts to promote innovative, multidisciplinary clinical and basic research on these diseases. This program supports multi-project collaborative applications designed to leverage expertise provided by Centers located throughout the United States.\\n    \\n \\n    Objectives and Scope\\n    \\n \\n    The objective of this NOFO is to support multidisciplinary research on the following conditions of interest: immunopathophysiology of asthma, rhinitis (allergic and non-allergic), chronic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and drug allergy. The overall goal of the AADCRC program is to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions and to provide a rational foundation for new, effective treatments and prevention strategies.\\n    \\n \\n \\n     NIAID programmatic priorities for this NOFO are to evaluate\\n     \\n    :\\n    \\n \\n \\n     The role of innate and adaptive immune functions in the development and pathogenesis of asthma and allergic diseases with a focus on severe asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and drug allergy;\\n     \\n \\n     The impact of the microbiome on immune responses as they pertain to the development, prevention, and management of asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, food allergy, and atopic dermatitis;\\n     \\n \\n     The impact of pollution, and/or acute or chronic climate events on immune responses as they pertain to the development, prevention and management of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis;\\n     \\n \\n     Epithelial biology/immunobiology and/or neuroimmune interactions and how they relate to development, persistence, and severity of allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, food allergy, and atopic dermatitis;\\n     \\n \\n     The interaction between infections and allergic diseases, and the role of immune responses to infections in the development and exacerbations of asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and atopic dermatitis;\\n     \\n \\n     The mechanisms of allergen immunotherapy-induced clinical desensitization and tolerance for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy and improving the efficacy, safety and ease of use of this therapeutic modality;\\n     \\n \\n     The genetic variations and epigenetic alterations affecting host immune responses to aeroallergens, food allergens and drug allergens and patient responses to therapeutic interventions in asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis and drug allergy;\\n     \\n \\n     Clinical, immunologic and physiologic phenotypes and endotypes of understudied diseases including non-Type 2 asthma, drug or vaccine allergy, chronic rhinosinusitis, non-allergic rhinitis syndromes, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), alpha-gal syndrome, and chronic spontaneous urticaria that provide mechanistic insights for disease etiology or management.\\n     \\n \\n \\n    In order to ensure the focus of the applications is on human disease, the majority of the proposed research within each application must be defined as human subjects research (for the HHS definition of human subjects research, please see the\\n     \\n     NIH Office of Extramural Research Human Subjects\\n     \\n    ) or utilize human material (including primary human cells, biologic samples, and clinical data). Studies using only transformed human cell lines will not satisfy this requirement. Very limited animal research may be included based on the need for experimentation that is not possible in humans or with human materials, and the animal studies must be fully justified and clearly integrated into an overall experimental plan that will translate animal findings to human disease.\\n    \\n \\n    Highly integrated and synergistic research Centers are encouraged for the AADCRC program. This includes multi-institutional applications for conditions of interest to this NOFO, especially where research resources are limited (\\n     \\n     e.g.\\n     \\n    , non-allergic rhinitis or drug allergy). AADCRC Research Centers funded under this NOFO will comprise multiple components to carry out the broad scope of research delineated above. Component Projects and Cores within a single application should not only relate to a central theme relevant to the specified diseases of interest, but also must be integrated with the other components within the same application.\\n    \\n \\n    In order to achieve this NOFO’s objective, it is recommended, but not required, that applications be drafted along the lines of either of the two models provided below:\\n    \\n \\n \\n     MODEL A – Pathway Focus\\n     \\n \\n \\n    The application focuses on the role of one or more immunologic mechanism(s)/pathway(s) that are hypothesized to be important pathobiologic processes in a condition of interest, as specified in this NOFO, or in allergy, in general. This/these mechanism(s)/pathway(s) may involve a single cellular or molecular species or several interrelated species, selected genes, a cell type, a micro-organism or a group of micro-organisms, an environmental factor or a group of environmental factors (such as allergens, microbes or pollutants). The application should include projects that examine such pathways from various perspectives, including clinical studies or pilot single-site clinical trials, genetics, systems biology approaches,\\n     \\n     in vitro\\n     \\n    work, or, if necessary, animal models. The proposed research must focus on human research, and utilize human material (including primary human cells, biologic samples, and clinical data). Very limited research using animal models may be proposed in parallel to human subjects research, only if it provides more in-depth hypothesis testing on outcomes that cannot be assessed with human research.\\n    \\n \\n \\n     MODEL B – Clinical Intervention/Observation Focus\\n     \\n \\n \\n    The application is centered around one or more single-site pilot clinical trials (interventions) or clinical studies (cross-sectional or short-term longitudinal observational studies, genetic studies) that test a novel therapeutic approach, a novel mechanistic hypothesis, or aim at elucidating disease phenotypes and endotypes in a condition of interest to this NOFO. The pilot clinical trial(s) or study(ies) constitute the source of material that supports the conduct of a series of associated studies that test the central hypothesis of the application in a comprehensive manner. The application should include projects built around the pilot clinical trial(s) or observational study(ies) including mechanistic studies, systems biology approaches (including genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, etc.), microbiome studies, or genetics. If proposed, pilot trials or studies must be single-site studies.\\n    \\n \\n    The majority of the proposed research must meet the HHS definition of human subjects research or utilize human material and should involve individuals with one or more of the conditions of interest named in this NOFO or clinical specimens from such individuals. Studies using human specimens obtained from relevant ongoing or completed clinical studies or clinical trials may also be proposed.\\n    \\n \\n    The NIH defines a clinical trial as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes (\\n     \\n     https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#ClinicalTrial\\n     \\n    ). For the purposes of this NOFO, a research study that meets this definition and involves interventions aimed at understanding mechanisms of disease (\\n     \\n     e.g.\\n     \\n    allergen challenges, experimental exposure of humans to an inflammatory mediator or to a rhinovirus), or aims at developing or evaluating clinical laboratory tests (imaging or molecular diagnostic tests) might be considered a clinical trial.\\n    \\n \\n    Clinical trials proposed for this NOFO should be limited in scope, with well-defined timelines supporting feasibility during the grant period. Clinical trials proposed should be single site pilot studies offering insight into mechanisms of disease or therapeutic response. Only new clinical trials can be proposed for this NOFO. A new trial is defined as one that has not previously recruited any subjects and will not be recruiting any subjects prior to award. If the proposed pilot clinical trials are intended to test a novel hypothesis, the pilot clinical trial must be proposed as a project and applicants must follow the instructions for the pilot clinical trial below. If two trials are highly related and share most aspects of study design, they can be presented within the same project.\\n    \\n \\n    Applicants are advised that, in the event their application is selected for NIAID funding, any proposed clinical trials will be reviewed by the Project Scientist(s) that NIAID will assign to the study; the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) Clinical Research Committee; and the DAIT Asthma and Allergy Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Final clinical protocols will be developed collaboratively.\\n    \\n \\n    It is the responsibility of the Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PD(s)/PI(s)) to contact regulatory authorities and obtain guidance as to the need for an Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) for interventions (whether to be used for therapeutic or mechanistic purposes) that are planned to be employed in any pilot clinical trial. If an IND is required, it is expected that, in most instances, either the recipient or the organization supplying the investigational agent or device will serve as the IND/IDE Sponsor. The Sponsor of an IND/IDE is responsible for the development, assembly, and submission of all required regulatory documents, and will provide NIAID all required information following NIH clinical research guidance and complying with NIH Grants Policy Statement. This includes, but is not limited to, all communications with the FDA (or other regulatory authority) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). However, NIAID reserves the right to decide whether it will be the Sponsor of a clinical trial and hold the IND. If NIAID is the IND/IDE Sponsor, it will be responsible for the development, assembly, and submission of all required regulatory documents, unless this responsibility is otherwise delegated by NIAID. If NIAID is the Sponsor, the PD(s)/PI(s) is responsible for providing all information to NIAID that is needed for compliance with FDA regulations.\\n    \\n \\n \\n     Applications including the following studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n     Research on autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases\\n     \\n \\n     Research on primary immune deficiency diseases\\n     \\n \\n     Research with a primary focus on chronic respiratory diseases other than asthma, rhinitis or rhinosinusitis\\n     \\n \\n     Demonstration and Education Research Projects\\n     \\n \\n     Multi-center clinical trials\\n     \\n \\n     Phase III clinical trials\\n     \\n \\n     Clinical trials at foreign sites; however foreign components conducting mechanistic projects, observational studies, specialized assay(s), etc. will be allowed.\\n     \\n \\n     Continuation of ongoing (active) clinical trials.\\n     \\n \\n     Applications in which the majority of the proposed research does not meet the\\n      \\n      human subjects research definition\\n      \\n     or\\xa0does\\xa0not utilize human material (including primary human cells, human biologic samples, or clinical data).\\n     \\n \\n     Research involving only healthy volunteers\\n     \\n \\n     Research on HIV or AIDS\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n     AADCRC components\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n     Administrative Core (required):\\n     \\n    Each application must contain an Administrative Core that is responsible for the overall management, communication, coordination, and supervision of the Center. Duties of the Administrative Core must include a plan of administering the AADCRC Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund (IOF). The Administrative Core Lead will provide leadership and guidance in fulfilling the stated objectives of the Center, and is responsible for generating, within the Administrative Core, an infrastructure that promotes cross-discipline interactions among all of the Cores and Research Projects and provides oversight and governance over fiscal and resource management.\\n    \\n \\n \\n     AADCRC IOF:\\n     \\n    A single IOF of up to $350,000 direct costs per year will be established under this NOFO to support new and pilot research projects led by investigators within the AADCRCs, as well as for\\xa0the development of resources that the AADCRC Steering Committee may deem necessary.\\xa0The IOF will support new research opportunities not proposed at the time of the awards. The Steering Committee will establish goals, priorities, and evaluation criteria for the use by the IOF. Any use of the IOF must comply with all applicable HHS/NIH policies. Post-award, PD(s)/PI(s) funded under this NOFO will have an opportunity to compete for IOF funds for new and pilot research projects and resource development projects and will be provided with details regarding IOF management and the application process.\\n    \\n \\n    After awards have been made, one AADCRC grant recipient institution will be selected by the NIAID to manage the IOF for the entire AADCRC program. This institution must agree to take responsibility for managing the IOF, including fund disbursement, administration, and reports.

pediatric psychologist who specializes in differences of sex development (DSD). Her overarching\\\\ncareer goal is to become an independently funded investigator focused on improving the psychosocial and\\\\nhealth outcomes of pediatric patients with DSD by creating tools to facilitate patient engagement in medical\\\\ndecision making through shared decision making (SDM). This award provides support for Dr. Suorsa-Johnson\\\\nto achieve the following Career Development Aims: Aim 1: Obtain expertise in SDM, including the\\\\ndevelopment of decision aids (DAs) for adolescents and young adults (AYAs); Aim 2: Gain sexual health\\\\neducation training, particularly as it relates to the creation of educational materials to enhance surgical SDM;\\\\nAim 3: Develop expertise in evaluating and implementing DAs; and Aim 4: Expand and strengthen research\\\\nleadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson has assembled a dedicated\\\\nteam of mentors and advisors with expertise in SDM (Angela Fagerlin, PhD), SDM in AYAs (Ellen Lipstein,\\\\nMD), sexual health education (Jordan Rullo, PhD), dissemination and implementation science (Jennie Hill,\\\\nPhD), qualitative design and clinical trials (Melissa Watt, PhD and Angela Fagerlin, PhD), multi-site trial design\\\\n(Gregory Stoddard, MBA, MPH), urogenital/gonadal surgeries in AYAs (Kathleen van Leeuwen, PhD), and\\\\nDSD education (David Sandberg, PhD and Erica Weidler, MEd, MS). A person with lived experience, Noi\\\\nLiang, MBA, MCPA, is consulting to ensure all aspects of the project align with the needs of those with DSD.\\\\nDSD are congenital conditions where chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex development is atypical. AYAs\\\\nwith DSD make critical and potentially irreversible, life-altering urogenital/gonadal surgical decisions. However,\\\\nwe know little about how AYAs approach surgical decision making and no standardized SDM resources exist.\\\\nAs such, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson proposes to create and pilot a set of surgical DAs for AYAs with DSD. This will\\\\nbe achieved through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify informational needs and values influencing surgical\\\\ndecision making for AYAs with DSD; Aim 2: Develop a set of evidence-based DAs for surgical decisions to\\\\nfacilitate SDM for AYAs and their caregivers; and Aim 3: Pilot test and refine DA content, delivery, and\\\\nfeasibility. This project will result in a set of surgical decision aids ready to be tested in a multi-site trial.\\\\nThis project is significant because it will change how we provide care and improve engagement in surgical\\\\ndecision making for this underserved, NIH-designated sexual and gender minority subpopulation. This\\\\ninnovative project is the first to explore the needs of AYAs with DSD making surgical decisions from a SDM\\\\nframework and create associated decision support tools.\", \"project_title\": \"Adolescents and Young Adults: Dilemmas, Education, and Choices Impacting Decisions (AYAs DECIDe) Study\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nAdolescents and young adults with differences of sex development make critical and potentially irreversible,\\\\nlife-altering surgical decisions about their bodies without standardized resources to support their engagement\\\\nin shared decision making.

SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\\\\nHereditary deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT, E.C. 2.7.7.12) activity in humans\\\\ncan lead to a potentially lethal disease called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Despite the life-saving\\\\nconsequences of newborn screening, early diagnosis, and a galactose-restricted diet, affected women\\\\ninvariably show ovarian damage and fertility impairment representing the greatest burden of their disease.\\\\nThere are currently no satisfactory treatments available to prevent this complication. Recently, insights into\\\\nthe underlying pathophysiology and innovative technological advancements have become available, and\\\\noptions for curative treatment have emerged. Using this momentum, we aim to develop a treatment to\\\\nprevent fertility impairments. We aim to 1) develop a non-viral nucleic acid therapy approach that targets the\\\\novary and 2) determine the optimal timing to rescue the ovarian function. Folliculogenesis is driven by the\\\\ncross-talk between oocytes and granulosa cells. Restoration of GALT activity in these cells could possibly\\\\nrescue the ovarian damage.\\\\nIn this pilot grant application, we will explore a new modality of gene therapy using nanoparticles\\\\nencapsulating episomal GALT cDNA within a non-viral expression vector. This will include determination of\\\\nthe optimal cationic polymer layer for delivery of episomal DNA plasmids expressing GFP or GALT to\\\\ngranulosa cell lines and the addition of ligands to encourage uptake and promote specificity.\\\\nIn addition, we will determine the optimal window of opportunity for this treatment. A prenatal origin has been\\\\nconsidered for decades whereas the data currently available, albeit scarce, favor a postnatal origin. There is\\\\nundoubtedly early damage, but whether treatments aimed to prevent ovarian damage needs to be started in\\\\nthe neonatal period, or treating in infancy or adolescence would suffice, is not clear. This will be studied using\\\\nthe zebrafish model for classic galactosemia that mimics the fertility impairments and is suitable for studies\\\\nthrough development. Zebrafish reproduction is regulated by the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis, comparable\\\\nto the human situation. For this purpose, RNA-seq, histology/immunohistochemistry of follicole\\\\ndevelopment and single cell RNA-seq of oocytes and granulosa cells at 4 developmental stages will\\\\nbe studied. These studies will uncover developmental stage and cell-specific alterations in the affected\\\\novaries. Distinctive patterns at the different stages are expected to reveal at which stage(s) damage\\\\ncan be prevented/halted using ovary targeted gene therapy.\", \"project_title\": \"Optimal Window of Opportunity for Granulosa Cell Gene Therapy in Galactosemia\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\n Hypergonadotropic hypoestrogenic infertility due to ovarian damage is the greatest burden for women\\\\nsuffering from hereditary Classic Galactosemia, an inborn error of metabolism included in the newborn\\\\nscreening programs.

\"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\\\nThis is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Kathleen M. Job, a clinical pharmacologist and young\\\\ninvestigator pursuing patient-oriented clinical research into how pregnancy and chronic disease\\\\ninfluences drug disposition and action. This K23 award will provide Dr. Job with support necessary for\\\\ncareer development in the following areas: (1) advanced pharmacometric techniques; (2) pregnancy\\\\nand maternal-fetal science; (3) clinical trial design and management in pregnant populations; and (4)\\\\nleading an interdisciplinary research program. By acquiring these skills, Dr. Job will fulfill her career\\\\ngoal of becoming an independent investigator who advances clinical care by integrating physiology\\\\nand pharmacology into approaches for designing, conducting, and interpreting clinical trials in\\\\npregnant individuals. To achieve these goals, Dr. Job has assembled a mentoring team comprising a\\\\nprimary mentor, Dr. Kevin Watt, an expert in PBPK modeling in special populations, and co-mentors,\\\\nDr. Torri Metz, a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine and clinical research, Dr. Christina Chambers,\\\\nan expert in epidemiology of drugs during pregnancy and health outcomes, and Dr. Andr\\\\u00e9 Dallmann,\\\\na leader in physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling in pregnant populations.\\\\nAsthma is the most common chronic condition associated with pregnancy and affects up to 300,000\\\\npregnancies every year in the United States. Asthma drugs are critical for achieving and maintaining\\\\nproper control of asthma symptoms. The pharmacokinetics of these drugs can be affected by the\\\\naltered physiology and lead to unacceptable drug-related toxicity or treatment failure. Progressive\\\\nchanges to physiology occur throughout pregnancy. In the current proposal, Dr. Kathleen Job will\\\\ndetermine optimal dosing of two common asthma medications in pregnant individuals. In Aim 1, she\\\\nwill develop maternal-fetal PBPK models for these asthma medications. In Aim 2, she will evaluate\\\\nmodel predictions with data from prospective clinical pharmacokinetic studies in pregnant individuals\\\\nwith asthma. In Aim 3, she will develop pharmacodynamic models for the drugs of interest in pregnant\\\\nindividuals with asthma with data collected as part of the prospective clinical pharmacokinetic studies\\\\nin pregnant individuals. Findings will inform a Phase II/III Phase II/III safety and efficacy trial in\\\\npregnant individuals with asthma and build a platform that can be applied to dosing of any drug at any\\\\nstage of pregnancy. This research will prepare Dr. Job to design and implement scientifically rigorous\\\\nand ethical drug trials in pregnant populations.\", \"project_title\": \"Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling of Asthma Drugs during Pregnancy\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nThe lack of appropriate dosing information in pregnant individuals with uncontrolled asthma is an\\\\nunmet public health need that can result in therapeutic failure and death.

children with chronic diseases, who have\\\\ncomplex, multisystem chronic diseases affecting \\\\u22653 organ systems, severe functional limitations and technology\\\\ndependencies. CMC have high health care needs, and account for 40% of hospitalized children and 35% of all\\\\npediatric health care costs. Due to high medical fragility, CMC have frequent acute deteriorations superimposed\\\\non their chronic conditions, leading to recurrent emergency department (ED)/hospital admissions and affecting\\\\nquality of life (QOL). To reduce ED/hospital admissions for CMC, remote monitoring is suggested, with use of\\\\nmHealth apps to regularly assess their health status remotely and identify early signs of acute deterioration,\\\\nallowing for early interventions to prevent ED/hospital admissions. Yet no app to support remote monitoring of\\\\nCMC exists. Variable, multisystem conditions among CMC make it difficult to develop an app. Also, many CMC\\\\nare at high-risk for health care inequities, with minorities having higher unmet needs, but the impacts of health\\\\ncare inequities and social determinants of health (SDOH) on ED/hospital admissions in CMC are rarely studied.\\\\nFortunately, ED/hospital admissions for CMC are often preceded by a limited set of shared (crosscutting) acute\\\\nsymptoms. These crosscutting symptoms rarely occur suddenly. Studies suggest that they usually start as subtle\\\\nsigns, often unnoticed by parents until they escalate to prompt an ED/hospital visit. Thus, crosscutting symptoms\\\\noffer an opportunity for a novel and practical approach for developing a remote monitoring app for CMC,\\\\ndespite their multiple, variable underlying conditions. In a focus group, parents identified the crosscutting\\\\nsymptoms that most often preceded their children\\\\u2019s hospital admissions, and conveyed their needs, preferences\\\\nand key functionalities that led to MyChildCMC, the first app designed to monitor and identify early signs of\\\\ncrosscutting symptoms in CMC. In a pilot trial of 50 subjects, we confirmed feasibility of MyChildCMC use by\\\\nparents, ability to detect early signs 2-14 days prior to ED/hospital admissions, and use leading significantly to\\\\nfewer hospital days than controls. The current study will assess the efficacy and sustainability of MyChildCMC\\\\nin a fully-powered 6-month, 2-arm (MyChildCMC vs usual care) trial of CMC (age 1-18 years) and their parents.\\\\nParents assigned to MyChildCMC will use the app daily for 6 months, both arms will receive financial incentive\\\\nfor participation, then we will stop the incentive and follow subjects for 6 more months to assess sustainability at\\\\n12 months. We will also assess if MyChildCMC use will help reduce or eliminate inequities in ED/hospital\\\\nadmissions. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine MyChildCMC\\\\u2019s efficacy on 1.a. Child (ED/hospital use, hospital\\\\ndays and QOL) and 1.b. Parent (satisfaction, self-efficacy and stress) outcomes; 2) Compare ED/hospital use\\\\namong racial/ethnic and SDOH subgroups to assess potential effect of MyChildCMC on inequities; 3) Use mixed\\\\nmethods to identify child and parent factors associated with MyChildCMC\\\\u2019s use adherence and sustainability.\", \"project_title\": \"A Novel mHealth Intervention to Improve Outcomes of Children with Medical Complexity\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nFindings from this project will provide an effective, practical, and generalizable approach to supporting home\\\\nmonitoring of children with medical complexity (CMC).

pediatric psychologist who specializes in differences of sex development (DSD). Her overarching\\\\ncareer goal is to become an independently funded investigator focused on improving the psychosocial and\\\\nhealth outcomes of pediatric patients with DSD by creating tools to facilitate patient engagement in medical\\\\ndecision making through shared decision making (SDM). This award provides support for Dr. Suorsa-Johnson\\\\nto achieve the following Career Development Aims: Aim 1: Obtain expertise in SDM, including the\\\\ndevelopment of decision aids (DAs) for adolescents and young adults (AYAs); Aim 2: Gain sexual health\\\\neducation training, particularly as it relates to the creation of educational materials to enhance surgical SDM;\\\\nAim 3: Develop expertise in evaluating and implementing DAs; and Aim 4: Expand and strengthen research\\\\nleadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson has assembled a dedicated\\\\nteam of mentors and advisors with expertise in SDM (Angela Fagerlin, PhD), SDM in AYAs (Ellen Lipstein,\\\\nMD), sexual health education (Jordan Rullo, PhD), dissemination and implementation science (Jennie Hill,\\\\nPhD), qualitative design and clinical trials (Melissa Watt, PhD and Angela Fagerlin, PhD), multi-site trial design\\\\n(Gregory Stoddard, MBA, MPH), urogenital/gonadal surgeries in AYAs (Kathleen van Leeuwen, PhD), and\\\\nDSD education (David Sandberg, PhD and Erica Weidler, MEd, MS). A person with lived experience, Noi\\\\nLiang, MBA, MCPA, is consulting to ensure all aspects of the project align with the needs of those with DSD.\\\\nDSD are congenital conditions where chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex development is atypical. AYAs\\\\nwith DSD make critical and potentially irreversible, life-altering urogenital/gonadal surgical decisions. However,\\\\nwe know little about how AYAs approach surgical decision making and no standardized SDM resources exist.\\\\nAs such, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson proposes to create and pilot a set of surgical DAs for AYAs with DSD. This will\\\\nbe achieved through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify informational needs and values influencing surgical\\\\ndecision making for AYAs with DSD; Aim 2: Develop a set of evidence-based DAs for surgical decisions to\\\\nfacilitate SDM for AYAs and their caregivers; and Aim 3: Pilot test and refine DA content, delivery, and\\\\nfeasibility. This project will result in a set of surgical decision aids ready to be tested in a multi-site trial.\\\\nThis project is significant because it will change how we provide care and improve engagement in surgical\\\\ndecision making for this underserved, NIH-designated sexual and gender minority subpopulation. This\\\\ninnovative project is the first to explore the needs of AYAs with DSD making surgical decisions from a SDM\\\\nframework and create associated decision support tools.\", \"project_title\": \"Adolescents and Young Adults: Dilemmas, Education, and Choices Impacting Decisions (AYAs DECIDe) Study\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nAdolescents and young adults with differences of sex development make critical and potentially irreversible,\\\\nlife-altering surgical decisions about their bodies without standardized resources to support their engagement\\\\nin shared decision making. To fill this gap, the proposed research will examine the decisional needs of\\\\nadolescents and young adults with differences of sex development, as well as develop and pilot a set of\\\\nsurgical decision aids addressing identified needs. Standardized decision aid use will promote adolescent and\\\\nyoung adult engagement in shared decision making, leading to improved care, patient health, and\\\\npsychosocial outcomes.\", \"spending_categories_desc\": null, \"agency_code\": \"NIH\", \"budget_start\": \"2024-09-18T12:09:00Z\", \"budget_end\": \"2025-06-30T12:06:00Z\", \"funding_mechanism\": \"Other Research-Related\", \"direct_cost_amt\": 155051, \"indirect_cost_amt\": 12404, \"project_detail_url\": \"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10985653\"}')]\n"

pediatric psychologist who specializes in differences of sex development (DSD). Her overarching\\ncareer goal is to become an independently funded investigator focused on improving the psychosocial and\\nhealth outcomes of pediatric patients with DSD by creating tools to facilitate patient engagement in medical\\ndecision making through shared decision making (SDM). This award provides support for Dr. Suorsa-Johnson\\nto achieve the following Career Development Aims: Aim 1: Obtain expertise in SDM, including the\\ndevelopment of decision aids (DAs) for adolescents and young adults (AYAs); Aim 2: Gain sexual health\\neducation training, particularly as it relates to the creation of educational materials to enhance surgical SDM;\\nAim 3: Develop expertise in evaluating and implementing DAs; and Aim 4: Expand and strengthen research\\nleadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson has assembled a dedicated\\nteam of mentors and advisors with expertise in SDM (Angela Fagerlin, PhD), SDM in AYAs (Ellen Lipstein,\\nMD), sexual health education (Jordan Rullo, PhD), dissemination and implementation science (Jennie Hill,\\nPhD), qualitative design and clinical trials (Melissa Watt, PhD and Angela Fagerlin, PhD), multi-site trial design\\n(Gregory Stoddard, MBA, MPH), urogenital/gonadal surgeries in AYAs (Kathleen van Leeuwen, PhD), and\\nDSD education (David Sandberg, PhD and Erica Weidler, MEd, MS). A person with lived experience, Noi\\nLiang, MBA, MCPA, is consulting to ensure all aspects of the project align with the needs of those with DSD.\\nDSD are congenital conditions where chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex development is atypical. AYAs\\nwith DSD make critical and potentially irreversible, life-altering urogenital/gonadal surgical decisions. However,\\nwe know little about how AYAs approach surgical decision making and no standardized SDM resources exist.\\nAs such, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson proposes to create and pilot a set of surgical DAs for AYAs with DSD. This will\\nbe achieved through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify informational needs and values influencing surgical\\ndecision making for AYAs with DSD; Aim 2: Develop a set of evidence-based DAs for surgical decisions to\\nfacilitate SDM for AYAs and their caregivers; and Aim 3: Pilot test and refine DA content, delivery, and\\nfeasibility. This project will result in a set of surgical decision aids ready to be tested in a multi-site trial.\\nThis project is significant because it will change how we provide care and improve engagement in surgical\\ndecision making for this underserved, NIH-designated sexual and gender minority subpopulation. This\\ninnovative project is the first to explore the needs of AYAs with DSD making surgical decisions from a SDM\\nframework and create associated decision support tools.\", \"project_title\": \"Adolescents and Young Adults: Dilemmas, Education, and Choices Impacting Decisions (AYAs DECIDe) Study\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\nAdolescents and young adults with differences of sex development make critical and potentially irreversible,\\nlife-altering surgical decisions about their bodies without standardized resources to support their engagement\\nin shared decision making. To fill this gap, the proposed research will examine the decisional needs of\\nadolescents and young adults with differences of sex development, as well as develop and pilot a set of\\nsurgical decision aids addressing identified needs. Standardized decision aid use will promote adolescent and\\nyoung adult engagement in shared decision making, leading to improved care, patient health, and\\npsychosocial outcomes.\", \"spending_categories_desc\": null, \"agency_code\": \"NIH\", \"budget_start\": \"2024-09-18T12:09:00Z\", \"budget_end\": \"2025-06-30T12:06:00Z\", \"funding_mechanism\": \"Other Research-Related\", \"direct_cost_amt\": 155051, \"indirect_cost_amt\": 12404, \"project_detail_url\": \"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10985653\"}' metadata={'source': '/Users/christinemahler/Desktop/AIE5/Midterm/data/response_data.json', 'seq_num': 1, '_id': 'd6bf1c9fe22749388838ebaefa045cb0', '_collection_name': 'projects'}\n",

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     Purpose\\n     \\n \\n \\n    The intent of this NOFO is to encourage applications from academic, biotechnology, biomedical device industry, or pharmaceutical industry investigators interested in participating with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) \\xa0in a National Cooperative Drug/Device Discovery/Development Group (NCDDG) program. The objectives of this program are: to advance the discovery, preclinical development, early-stage human studies, and/or proof of concept (PoC)\\xa0testing of new, rationally based candidate agents or devices to treat mental disorders; and to develop novel ligands and novel brain circuit-modulator technologies as tools to advance biological research on the function of genes, cells, biochemical pathways, distributed neural circuits, and neural oscillatory patterns implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of mental disorders, and as potential new therapeutics. Partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged.\\n    \\n \\n    Each NCDDG program should consist of a multidisciplinary team of scientists with appropriate expertise to further the development and evaluation of novel candidate agents or proposed biomedical devices. Scientists from both academia and the pharmaceutical industry are encouraged to participate within an NCDDG; scientists from foreign institutions and NIH Intramural laboratories may participate in some aspects. It is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with industry and NIH via the NCDDG model will: 1) accelerate the discovery and development of new therapeutics for mental disorders; 2) increase the availability of pharmacologic and device-based research tools (including imaging agents) for basic and clinical research; 3) facilitate the development and validation of neurophysiological and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) measures to evaluate novel therapeutics for mental disorders; 4) increase the availability of new compounds, agents, and devices suitable for testing in humans; 5) facilitate the development and validation of new clinical measures or biomarkers suitable for use in human PoC trials of novel therapeutics for mental disorders; and/or 6) develop and validate novel neurostimulation technologies and protocols for mental disorders.\\n    \\n \\n    The goal of the NCDDG program is not to duplicate or compete with the private sector but to complement and accelerate the development of research tools for new molecular and circuit targets implicated in mental disorders, and effective compounds, agents, and devices for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders, as well as core features of these illnesses, especially in areas of unmet medical need.\\n    \\n \\n \\n     Background and Research Objectives\\n     \\n \\n \\n    Significant advances in neuroscience, genomics, genetics, and related omics, behavioral neuroscience, together with technological developments (structural biology,\\n     \\n     in silico\\n     \\n    and high throughput screening (HTS),\\n     \\n     in vivo\\n     \\n    imaging methods), have provided a rich knowledge base for understanding pathophysiology, identifying new molecular targets for drug discovery, new circuit/oscillatory targets for device development, and developing rational pharmacotherapies and neuromodulation interventions for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. With the wealth of potential new drug/device targets, the opportunity exists to accelerate the process of target validation and medication discovery to make great strides toward novel and effective treatments for mental disorders.\\n    \\n \\n    An application submitted to this NOFO can include two to three scientific projects along with Scientific and/or Administrative Cores. Applications proposing only a single research project and no cores should respond to the companion NOFO utilizing the U01 mechanism (see\\n     \\n     PAR-25-352\\n     \\n    ).\\n    \\n \\n    Points to consider relevant to this announcement:\\n    \\n \\n \\n     The development of analogs of established or well-studied agents for the treatment of mental disorders is not appropriate for this NOFO.\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n     NIMH\\'s Objectives and Interests for the NCDDG Program\\n     \\n \\n \\n    NIMH’s objective for the NCDDG program is to support innovative, high-impact research focused on the discovery of pharmacological agents selective for novel molecular targets and new neuromodulation devices targeting novel neural circuit and neural oscillatory targets with the potential to prevent or reverse pathophysiological processes underlying mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, fragile x, autism, and other mental illnesses. Public-private partnerships are particularly encouraged.\\n    \\n \\n    NIMH-relevant NCDDG research projects should focus on novel interventions, using either pharmacological agents or neuromodulation devices that interrogate a molecular, circuit, or clinical target that is linked to a biological mechanism or pathophysiology of the proposed mental disorder.\\n    \\n \\n    The NIMH strongly encourages an experimental medicine approach to therapeutic development. This NOFO will support up through First-in-Human (FIH) for devices or Phase Ia or Ib trials for pharmacological agents. For these trials, studies are expected to assess the agent/device for 1) safety and tolerability, 2) target engagement, and 3) pharmacodynamic effects on relevant circuits or systems. Data resulting from Phase I trials in healthy controls and in the target patient population are expected to determine optimal clinical dosing and to establish feasibility for further testing in PoC and efficacy trials.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     Purpose\\n     \\n \\n \\n    The intent of this NOFO is to encourage applications from academic, biotechnology, biomedical device industry, or pharmaceutical industry investigators interested in participating with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in a National Cooperative Drug/Device Discovery/Development Group (NCDDG) program. The objectives of this program are: to advance the discovery, preclinical development, early-stage human studies, and/or proof of concept testing of new, rationally based candidate agents or devices to treat mental disorders, and to develop novel ligands and novel brain circuit-modulatory technologies as tools to advance biological research on the function of genes, cells, biochemical pathways, distributed neural circuits, and neural oscillatory patterns implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of mental disorders, and as potential new therapeutics. Partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged. This program strongly encourages in-kind resource contributions of the partners within the NCDDG (e.g., biotechnology, pharmaceutical, or disease foundations).\\n    \\n \\n    Each NCDDG program should consist of a multidisciplinary team of scientists with appropriate expertise to further the development and evaluation of novel candidate agents or proposed biomedical devices. Scientists from both academia and pharmaceutical industry are encouraged to participate within an NCDDG; scientists from foreign institutions and NIH Intramural laboratories may participate in some aspects. It is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with industry and NIH via the NCDDG model will: 1) accelerate the discovery and development of new therapeutics for mental disorders; 2) increase the availability of pharmacologic and device-based research tools (including Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging agents) for basic and clinical research; 3) facilitate the development and validation of neurophysiological, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) measures to evaluate novel therapeutics for mental disorders; 4) increase the availability of new compounds, agents, and devices suitable for testing in humans; 5) facilitate the development and validation of new clinical measures or biomarkers suitable for use in human Proof of Concept (PoC) trials of novel therapeutics for mental disorders; and/or 6) develop and validate novel neurostimulation technologies and protocols for mental disorders.\\n    \\n \\n    The goal of the NCDDG program is not to duplicate or compete with the private sector but to complement and accelerate the development of research tools for new molecular and circuit targets implicated in mental disorders, and effective compounds, agents, and devices for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders, as well as core features of these illnesses, especially in areas of unmet medical need.\\n    \\n \\n \\n     Background and Research Objectives\\n     \\n \\n \\n    Significant advances in neuroscience, genetics, genomics, and related omics, behavioral neuroscience, together with technological developments (structural biology,\\n     \\n     in silico\\n     \\n    and high throughput screening,\\n     \\n     in vivo\\n     \\n    imaging methods), have provided a rich knowledge base for understanding pathophysiology, identifying new molecular targets for drug discovery, new circuit/oscillatory targets for device development, and developing rational pharmacotherapies and neuromodulation interventions for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. With the wealth of potential new drug/device targets, the opportunity exists to accelerate the process of target validation and medication discovery to make great strides toward novel and effective treatments for mental disorders.\\n    \\n \\n    A U01 application can include no more than a single Research Project.

Public-Private partnerships are particularly encouraged.\\n    \\n \\n    NIMH-relevant NCDDG research projects should focus on novel interventions, using either pharmacological agents or neuromodulation devices that interrogate a molecular, circuit or clinical target that is linked to a biological mechanism or pathophysiology of the proposed mental disorder.\\n    \\n \\n    The NIMH strongly encourages an experimental medicine approach to therapeutic development. This NOFO will support up through First-in-Human (FIH) for devices or Phase Ia or Ib trials for pharmacological agents. For these trials, studies are expected to assess the agent/device for 1) safety and tolerability, 2) target engagement, and 3) pharmacodynamic effects on relevant circuits or systems. Data resulting from Phase I trials in healthy controls and in the target patient population are expected to determine optimal clinical dosing and to establish feasibility for further testing in PoC and efficacy trials. Agents/devices should be sufficiently potent and selective for critical evaluation of target engagement and brain exposure. The agent/indication (if successful) should have a major, not merely incremental, impact on unmet medical need in psychiatric disorders.
