Given the study details and the complexity involved, we will draft an appropriate NIH budget allocation for multiple years based on the necessary roles. The percentage effort per study year will be calculated with special consideration to handling intensive data, regulatory compliance, sophisticated IT infrastructure, and complex operational coordination as highlighted in the specifics of the NIH funding opportunity PA-25-147.

These allocations are designed to ensure that the study has a continuous, consistent amount of effort across all critical roles throughout its lifespan, while allowing for adjustments according to the phases of the study. These percentages are estimates based on standard NIH guidelines and the complexity score of the study, allowing for optimal staff involvement to meet the extensive demands of the high-risk multi-center clinical trial.
