		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p style="margin-left:0in;">This limited competition notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) invites&nbsp;investigators currently funded through the NIH Implementing a Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/IMPROVE">IMPROVE</a>)<strong> </strong>Initiative to develop&nbsp;applications to test the feasibility of complementary and integrative approaches with psychological and/or physical inputs (often called mind and body interventions) to promote healthy pregnancies and enhance maternal health outcomes. Currently funded IMPROVE investigators, particularly those of the Maternal Health Centers of Excellence, are encouraged to partner with investigators with complementary and integrative health expertise. Eligibility is limited to currently funded investigators of the IMPROVE Initiative. Applications submitted under this NOFO are expected to propose a multi-site feasibility clinical trial that will provide new information that is scientifically necessary for the planning and conduct of a subsequent clinical efficacy or effectiveness study, pragmatic trial, or dissemination and implementation trial on a mind and body intervention to enhance maternal health. It is expected that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned future clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R01) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent fully powered, full-scale clinical trial. Under this R01, the data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge, including, but not limited to, the following: assessing whether the intervention can be delivered with fidelity across sites; demonstrating feasibility of recruitment, accrual, and randomization of participants across sites; demonstrating participant adherence to the intervention, as well as retention of participants throughout the study across sites; refining and assessing the feasibility of protocolized multimodal interventions; and/or demonstrating feasibility of data collection across sites in preparation for a future fully powered, multi-site efficacy or effectiveness trial. The need for multi-site feasibility trials is expected to be justified by sufficient preliminary data from previous single-site feasibility or acceptability trial(s) or the published literature. The data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge and be necessary to develop a competitive fully powered multi-site clinical trial that has the potential to make a significant impact on public health.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Prior to submitting to this NOFO, applicants are encouraged to contact the appropriate Scientific/Research Contact person for the science area of the planned application.&nbsp;</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220473' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Background</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Among high-income countries, the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate. The maternal health crisis disproportionately affects Black/African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native women.&nbsp;Disparities also exist by age, education, socioeconomic status, and geographic region. Improving maternal health is a national priority as reflected by the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Maternal-Health-Blueprint.pdf">White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis</a>. The national focus on the maternal health crisis has resulted in several initiatives by the National Institute of Health (NIH). The NIH Implementing a Maternal Health and PRegnancy Outcome Vision for Everyone (<a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/improve-initiative">IMPROVE</a>) Initiative is one such effort, which was launched in 2019 to support research to address the high rates of pregnancy-related complications (i.e., severe maternal morbidity) and deaths (i.e., maternal mortality) in the United States. The IMPROVE effort is a multipronged initiative designed to build the evidence base of maternal health-related solutions for all women to promote maternal health equity.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The initiative encompasses several integrated components, including the Maternal Health Research Centers of Excellence (CoEs) which utilize innovative approaches to design and conduct research projects in partnership with communities most affected (i.e., populations with health disparities; maternity care deserts) to reduce preventable causes of maternal deaths and improve health for women before, during, and after pregnancy. With support from a Data Innovation and Coordination Hub and the Implementation Science Hub, the research centers share lessons learned, participate in training and research, and disseminate their results. In addition to conducting research projects and building community partnerships, the centers have a robust training and professional development element to grow the maternal health workforce. Although the IMPROVE Maternal Health Centers of Excellence encompass a wide variety of topics and conditions that impact maternal health, complementary and integrative health approaches are not a central feature of the interventions. Complementary and integrative health approaches are widely used by the public, and they are increasingly recognized as a nonpharmacologic approach to symptom management (e.g., chronic pain, mild depression, anxiety). These approaches have been used by individuals to help prevent, treat, or self-manage various conditions before, during, and after pregnancy, and they can be complementary to conventional health care. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these interventions suggest there is a need for more rigorous studies to improve the evidence base of complementary and integrative approaches with physical and/or psychological inputs (often called mind and body interventions) that can inform maternal health clinical practice guidelines.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Although the scientific literature may provide the rationale for conducting an efficacy or effectiveness trial, investigators may lack critical information about key elements needed to plan and conduct such a trial. Some key aspects that may need further investigation to plan the future clinical trial could include refining or adapting the intervention to specific populations, modalities, or settings; assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to protocolized interventions; finalizing the intervention delivery method, and determining appropriate outcome(s), or recruitment strategies. Early phase clinical trials supported under this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) can fill this information gap, thereby improving study design and feasibility. That is, this NOFO will support multi-site feasibility trials that can provide valuable information regarding whether the intervention can be delivered with fidelity by multiple providers across multiple sites; determine feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and retention strategies; and test methods for consistent data collection including follow-up data to minimize missing data<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>It is expected that multi-site feasibility trials funded by this NOFO will allow investigators to collect preliminary data needed to develop future applications for fully powered efficacy and effectiveness trials of mind and body approaches to promote healthy pregnancies and/or improve maternal health.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Research Objectives of the Mind and Body Multi-Site Feasibility Clinical Trial in Maternal Health (R01)</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">This limited competition NOFO encourages investigators of the IMPROVE Initiative, particularly the Maternal Health Centers of Excellence, to partner with complementary and integrative health investigators to expand current projects and/or propose new pilot projects to test the multi-site feasibility of utilizing complementary and integrative health approaches with physical and/or psychological therapeutic inputs (often called mind and body interventions) to promote healthy pregnancies and/or enhance maternal health outcomes.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Applications submitted under this NOFO are expected to propose a multi-site feasibility clinical trial that will facilitate the design and execution of a future fully powered multi-site clinical trial (see examples below). To justify the need for a multi-site feasibility clinical trial, applicants must reference their own single-site feasibility trial preliminary data or extant published data (see preliminary data requirements below). If previous multi-site feasibility trials have been published, are completed, or underway, then further feasibility research may not be needed. Applications proposing such iterative or duplicative studies will be considered of low programmatic relevance. The application should address any remaining gaps in knowledge that are needed before conducting a fully powered, multi-site efficacy, effectiveness, pragmatic, or dissemination and implementation trial. Investigators should consult the NCCIH website (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/pilot-studies-common-uses-and-misuses) for more information on the uses and misuses of feasibility studies.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">For this NOFO, multi-site feasibility clinical trials are defined as trials that enroll research participants from at least two sites that are geographically distinct and non-overlapping with respect to the population of patients engaging with services and are likely to recruit diverse participants. Demonstrating the ability to deliver an intervention with fidelity across sites is critical to demonstrating the ability to later perform a fully powered multi-site efficacy or effectiveness clinical trial. Multiple sites are necessary in efficacy and effectiveness trials to increase the generalizability of the findings, by increasing the size and diversity of eligible participants to enhance recruitment efforts.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Appropriate goals for multi-site feasibility clinical trials proposed in response to this NOFO include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate feasibility of recruitment rate, randomization, and retention of participants across multiple sites.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Assess whether the intervention can be delivered with fidelity across sites, and/or assess whether minor intervention adaptation is useful to enhance adherence, outcome selection, and/or fidelity.</li><li>Demonstrate acceptability and/or adherence to a protocolized multi-component intervention across sites.</li><li>Demonstrate feasibility in measuring outcomes within designated time frames, training interventionists, and delivering the intervention with fidelity across sites.</li><li>Demonstrate participant adherence to the intervention throughout the study across sites.</li><li>Demonstrate consistent collection of clinical data, including follow-up data across sites.</li><li>Assess feasibility of strategies for integrating a mind and body approach into multiple health care systems to inform the execution of future pragmatic or implementation research trials.</li><li>Determine appropriate control/comparison conditions for future large-scale study.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Design Considerations</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Investigators should propose a randomized controlled trial design with at least one intervention arm and one comparator arm. There should be strong rationale for the comparator condition (e.g., time and attention control, usual care, standard of care, sham condition, and/or active comparator[s]) based on the research question you plan to address in the future powered trial. Due to lack of rigor and potential expectancy effects, this NOFO will not support studies proposing a wait list comparator condition.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The complementary or integrative approaches with physical and/or psychological therapeutic inputs (often called mind and body interventions) should include one or more of the following:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Physical approaches such, but not limited to, as spinal manipulation or mobilization, massage, tai chi, qi gong, yoga, acupuncture;</li><li>Psychological approaches such as, but not limited to, hypnosis, guided imagery, breathing exercises, progressive relaxation, meditation, biofeedback, mindfulness techniques,&nbsp;or music or other art-based therapies;</li><li>Multi-component interventions &nbsp;that may include the use of natural products such as naturopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine, chiropractic care, or a combination of two or more of the specific complementary health approaches (e.g., massage and biofeedback, or yoga and mindfulness); or integrated approaches to care in which a complementary health approach is used in combination with standard care (e.g., mindfulness or yoga as augmentation to conventional medications);</li><li>Multilevel intervention level (patient, caregivers of patient, clinicians, and health care system) where at least one level of intervention includes a mind and body intervention.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Power Recommendations</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Pilot or feasibility studies are carried out in preparation for future large-scale, adequately powered studies and therefore should address key issues of process (e.g., recruitment, retention, feasibility, adherence, and/or fidelity) and/or outcomes assessment (e.g., feasibility of the method, frequency, burden, and duration of data collection procedures). Given the limited sample sizes that can be supported under this R01 grant mechanism, proposing to conduct fully powered tests of clinical outcomes (i.e., efficacy) or underpowered tests of outcomes (i.e., "preliminary efficacy") or attempting to utilize the highly variable point estimate of an effect size for future power calculations of a larger scale study would not be appropriate and are noted as nonresponsive below. As pilot and feasibility studies are not designed (or powered) to address efficacy or effectiveness of an approach or intervention, statistical methods should be mainly descriptive. Applicants should use quantitative benchmarks corresponding to each assessment category in determining trial feasibility. Scientific and/or statistical justification should be provided to demonstrate how the sample size is sufficient to make a feasibility/acceptability determination in accordance with proposed benchmarks. Sample sizes used in pilot studies are not formally powered for testing prespecified hypotheses as conventionally expected for confirmatory studies. Sample sizes for subsequent fully powered studies should be based on an achievable, clinically meaningful improvement due to the intervention in the research population with appropriate power calculations. Investigators should consult the NCCIH website (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/pilot-studies-common-uses-and-misuses) for more information on the uses and misuses of feasibility studies.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Group-Based Interventions</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">In some cases, investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms, and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. Investigators should provide a strong rationale for the choice among trial design options. The selection of study design should be guided by decisions about how best to deliver the intervention and by concerns regarding contamination and logistics. Applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. Additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Mechanistic Measures</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">There are often questions about whether feasibility trials should include mechanistic aims to evaluate how interventions work. Trials submitted under this NOFO should not include aims to assess the impact/efficacy of an intervention on a mechanism of action or evaluate mediation effects. Mechanistic measures may be included in multi-site feasibility trials for the purpose of determining if collecting the mechanistic measure is feasible, which can inform whether mediation or moderation aims should be included in a future large-scale efficacy or effectiveness trial. Applications would need to justify why the mechanistic outcome(s) should be included in the future efficacy or effectiveness trial. The inclusion of mechanistic measures should not introduce a significant burden for participants or utilize a significant portion of the budget.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Preliminary Data About the Intervention:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">This NOFO is appropriate when there is a clear and compelling rationale, a rigorous empirical basis, and a scientific premise to conduct a multi-site feasibility trial. The following preliminary data from previous studies (preferred from published literature, or the team&#146;s previous research) on a similar intervention, patient population, and age group, as proposed in the current application, are required:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Demonstration that an intervention similar to the one proposed in the trial is well tolerated (does not produce frequent severe adverse events).</li><li>Pilot single-site feasibility data on a similar intervention in a similar clinical population to the proposed trial (e.g., a proposed study to examine yoga in postpartum women with anxiety may cite pilot work on yoga in a population of pregnant women with depression and anxiety).</li><li>Demonstrated adherence (e.g., cite a pilot study of similar duration with sufficient adherence).</li><li>Demonstrated retention of participants for a similar study duration (e.g., cite a pilot study that retained a sufficient percentage of participants at the primary outcome time point).</li><li>Information to justify the delivery mode, duration, frequency of the intervention (achieve and expected clinical benefit). For example, the intervention could be delivered as a single 30-minute session once a week for 8 weeks, or as self-paced 5-minute modules over 10 weeks. Preliminary data should demonstrate that the selected doses are feasible and likely to have the greatest impact on clinical outcome and minimize the risk of adverse events.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Preliminary Data about the Research Team:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">In addition, all the following information demonstrating the research team&#146;s collective experience conducting clinical trials is required:</p><ul><li>Delivered a similar intervention via the same delivery mode in a clinical trial with fidelity.</li><li>Successfully recruited, randomized, and retained similar participants.</li><li>Successfully randomized participants to similar intervention and control conditions.</li><li>Achieved adherence to a similar intervention study protocol by research staff.</li><li>Retained participants for a similar study duration.</li><li>Completed collection of follow-up data with consistency and minimal missing data.</li><li>Published results from previous completed trials.</li><li>For applications studying the feasibility or acceptability of including a natural product as part of a multi-component intervention, the application must provide published data that the formulation of the natural product proposed has demonstrated efficacy for the condition being studied from at least one fully powered placebo-controlled trial.</span></li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Timeline</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Investigators should propose a realistic timeline for the startup and completion of the clinical trial and provide contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances to the planned trial.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Institute and Center Specific Areas of Interest</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">NCCIH is interested in applications for multi-site feasibility trials that align with the NCCIH Strategic Plan (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/about/strategic-plans-and-reports). Areas of interest include but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Promotion of health behaviors, health restoration, emotional well-being, or resilience in birthing individuals;</p><ul><li>Prevention or treatment of symptoms and disorders, such as, obesity, sleep disorders or disturbances, depression, anxiety, chronic stress, post-traumatic stress (disorder), and acute and chronic pain conditions in birthing individuals;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Whole person health outcomes including multisystem or multilevel outcomes;</li><li>Minority health and reduction of disparities<sup>1</sup> in areas such as pain, obesity, mental and emotional behavioral health, and maternal health;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Assessment of multilevel factors, including social and structural determinants of health (<a href="https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/nih-sdohrcc">https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/nih-sdohrcc</a>), which impact implementation of the mind and body intervention;</li><li>Cultural and contextual adaptations of complementary and integrative health approaches to promote healthy pregnancies and enhance maternal health outcomes;</li><li>Novel continuum care models to implement complementary health approaches in conjunction with conventional care therapies to address risk of maternal morbidity and mortality and enhance maternal health outcomes;</li><li>Utilization of mHealth approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;">When evidence justifies, NCCIH encourages applications to conduct studies in a way that assesses the impact of integrating interventions into relevant settings (e.g., health care systems, Federally qualified health centers, military or veteran health care delivery organizations, community organizations, justice systems, or homeless shelters).</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">All NIH-funded research must adhere to the Code of Federal Regulations, which outlines specific requirements to enhance protections for pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates; children; and prisoners (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/human-subjects/policies-and-regulations/vulnerable-populations">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/policies-and-regulations/vulnerable-populations.htm</a>l). It is the policy of NIH that individuals of all ages, including children (i.e., individuals under the age of 18) and older adults, must be included in all human subjects research, conducted or supported by NIH, unless there are scientific or ethical reasons not to include them (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-116.html">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-116.html</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><sup>1</sup> NIH-designated health disparity populations include racial and ethnic minorities (African Americans/Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Other Pacific Islanders), sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and people with disabilities.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)</strong></p><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the IMPROVE initiative in 2019 in response to high rates of pregnancy-related complications and deaths, also called maternal morbidity and mortality, in the United States. The NIH Implementing a Maternal health and PRegnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (<a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/improve-initiative">IMPROVE</a>) Initiative aims to understand the biological, behavioral, environmental, sociocultural, and structural factors that affect pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality and build an evidence base for improved care and outcomes. The initiative supports research to reduce preventable causes of maternal deaths and severe maternal morbidity and improve health for women before, during, and after delivery, particularly for populations disproportionately affected.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>National Institute of mental Health (NIMH)</strong></p><p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is interested in supporting applications on pilot hybrid effectiveness implementation research focused on the prevention or treatment of maternal mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) and symptoms (e.g., intrusive thoughts, psychosis). The research supported through this RFA is consistent with NIMH&#146;s priorities for: 1) refining and optimizing preventive and therapeutic mental health interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy for use with broader populations or for delivery routine care, community, or online settings, and 2) research on implementation strategies that support the delivery and sustainability of evidence supported preventive and therapeutic interventions for maternal populations in accessible real-world settings.</p><p>NIMH encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention design and testing that considers the perspective of relevant end-users and the key characteristics of the intervention setting. &nbsp;Accordingly, applications to NIMH must propose to pilot a hybrid effectiveness implementation trial design that proposes to simultaneously explore the clinical impact of the intervention and implementation factors or strategies that impact intervention access, engagement, or sustainability. Consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas">NIMH experimental therapeutics approach</a>, all applications assigned to NIMH must also specify (1) at least one hypothesized mechanism of action for the intervention and/or implementation strategy, (2) measurement plans designed to feasibly assess the mechanism of action and primary mental health outcomes in the intended intervention setting, and (3) an analytic plan designed to explore changes in the mechanism of action and associations between changes in the mechanism of action and the primary outcome(s).</p><p>Projects seeking to adapt established evidence-based practices are required to provide an empirical rationale for the adaptation; a clear hypothesis and plan to address the mechanism by which the adapted intervention will enhance maternal mental health outcomes; and evidence to suggest that the adapted intervention will result in a substantial improvement in maternal mental health outcomes and disparities in access to care.</p><p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIMH program officials regarding the match between the potential application and current priorities and policies.</p><p>Specific areas of interest for NIMH include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Studies that include evidence supported approaches to prevent, treat, or self-manage maternal mental health disorders or symptoms before, during, and after pregnancy, and which may be complementary to conventional health care.</li><li>Adaptations to evidence supported psychosocial interventions that incorporate complementary approaches to address factors related to suboptimal intervention response, cultural fit, intervention engagement, or adherence.</li><li>Innovative approaches that seek to reduce disparities in maternal mental health intervention access, quality, and outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals with limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, groups that have economically/socially marginalized, and other underserved groups.</li><li>Personalized, modular, or stepped-care approaches for matching evidence supported psychosocial and complementary intervention components of varying intensity to maternal patient preferences or areas of greatest need.</li><li>Interventions that utilize social media and other digital technology to facilitate or augment maternal mental health access and service delivery.</li><li>Patient- and provider-level interventions designed to promote service access, use, engagement, and retention or improve quality or outcomes of care, especially in understudied areas of maternal mental health such as birth trauma and preterm birth.</li><li>Provider-level interventions, such as training and supervision approaches to increase the uptake, fidelity, and sustained use of evidence-based interventions that meet the needs of understudied maternal mental health disorders and symptoms or populations.</li><li>Studies to improve the evidence base of complementary and integrative approaches that can inform clinical practice and guidelines for maternal mental healthcare.</li></ul><p>NIMH will not accept assignment of:</p><ul><li>Applications that do not propose to pilot a hybrid effectiveness implementation trial design.</li><li>Applications that propose to test interventions or implementation strategies in research settings rather than routine care, community, school, or online settings and/or propose the use of research therapists or include other features specific to research or academic contexts.</li><li>Applications that do not propose preliminary exploratory evaluations of the mechanism(s) of action and its impact on the primary mental health outcomes, including the following components section of the application: (1) specified mechanism(s) of action; (2) measurement plans designed to assess the mechanism(s) of action and mental health outcomes in the intervention setting; and (3) a description of the analytic plan for exploring whether intervention-induced changes in the mechanism(s) of action are associated with mental health outcomes.</li><li>Applications that propose adaptations of existing interventions without a compelling empirical justification.</li><li>Applications that use patented medications that lack superior efficacy or safety relative to currently available off-patent medications.</li><li>Applications that propose to test health literacy interventions without explicitly examining the impact on service access, engagement, quality and/or mental health outcomes of care.</li><li>Applications that propose to evaluate service level interventions that incorporate multiple implementation strategies to increase access, use, reach, adoption, and implementation of mental health services.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH)</strong></p><p>The Office of Research on Women&#146;s Health (ORWH), part of the NIH Office of the Director, collaborates with 27 NIH Institutes and Centers to promote rigorous research focused on women&#146;s health issues.

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply- Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>

The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code.

	<ul>
		<li><a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11176">NATO Commercial and Government Entity (NCAGE) Code</a> &ndash; Foreign organizations must obtain an NCAGE code (in lieu of a CAGE code) in order to register in SAM.</li>

The body of the application should present a concise overview of the state of the science, the current status and relevance of the trial, a discussion of the specific protocol, and the approach to data collection, analysis, and dissemination.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The following criteria should be addressed:&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><i>Importance of the Research</i>: The significance of the proposed future efficacy or effectiveness clinical trial and importance of the question must be clearly stated. It is particularly important to include a discussion of how the future trial will test the proposed hypotheses and how or why there is clinical equipoise. The application should clearly state the need for and timeliness of both the future trial and the proposed multi-site feasibility trial, emphasizing how the results will address an evidence gap and therefore advance knowledge of theory and practice in this area. A discussion of the costs and benefits of the future trials should be included for evaluation of the trial's significance.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The importance of the proposed multi-site feasibility trial should be described and why it is scientifically necessary to plan the subsequent future trial. Discuss how the proposed trial will test the multi-site feasibility hypothesis and how the results of the trial (positive or negative) will guide decisions about whether a subsequent study is feasible, and/or evidence that additional studies must be completed before proceeding to the full-scale trial. Applications should address the reasons for selection of the intervention. This may include public health impact if subsequent efficacy trials are conducted and achieve positive results,&#8239;ethical dimensions, and patient perspectives on acceptability of the proposed intervention. Characteristics of any preliminary research results provided in support of the proposed project, whether conducted by the applicant or others, should be described in the application so peer reviewers may evaluate the strength of the supporting evidence. The applicant should also discuss the limitations of those data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Explain how the application challenges and seeks to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms or guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><i>Rigor and Feasibility</i>: This section should include a description of the supporting data, clinical trial experience, and experimental approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Supporting data: The studies that led to the proposed clinical trial should be presented. Data from pilot studies conducted by the team or published in the literature that show the need for and feasibility of the trial should also be presented. Additional supporting data from other research should be included so the approach chosen is clearly justified and adequately framed. Applications must include the following preliminary data from human studies (preferably published in the literature) using a similar intervention in a similar population to the one&#8239;proposed in the current study:&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">All of the following preliminary data about the intervention (from published literature or the team&#146;s previous research):&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Demonstration that a&#8239;similar intervention&#8239;to the one proposed in the trial is well tolerated (does not produce frequent severe adverse events) in pilot human studies.</li><li>Single-site feasibility data on a similar intervention in a maternal patient population similar to the one that will be studied in the proposed trial (e.g., a proposed study to examine vinyasa yoga in adults with anxiety may cite pilot work on hatha yoga in a population of adults with depression and anxiety).</li><li>Demonstrated adherence (e.g., cite a pilot study of a similar duration with sufficient adherence).</li><li>Demonstrated retention of participants for a similar study duration (e.g., cite a pilot study that retained a sufficient percentage of participants at the primary outcome time point).</li><li>Information to justify the selection of how the intervention is delivered (e.g., format of delivery, duration of individual intervention, frequency of delivery, and timeline of intervention delivery to achieve clinical benefit) in the study. For example, the intervention could be delivered as a single 30-minute session once a week for 8 weeks, or as self-paced 5-minute modules over 10 weeks. Preliminary data should demonstrate that the selected doses are feasible and likely to have the greatest impact on clinical outcome and minimize the risk of adverse events.&nbsp;</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;">All of the following preliminary data demonstrating the collective team&#146;s experience conducting clinical trials:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Delivered a similar intervention via the same delivery mode in a single site clinical trial with fidelity.</li><li>Successfully recruited and accrued similar participants.</li><li>Successfully randomized participants to similar intervention and control conditions.</li><li>Achieved adherence to a similar intervention study protocol by research staff.</li><li>Retained participants for a similar study duration.</li><li>Completed collection of follow-up data with consistency and minimal missing data.</li><li>Published results from previous completed trials.</li><li>A description of why the target population is an appropriate group for addressing the proposed hypotheses and how or if results can be generalized to a broader population.</li><li>A description of the mind and body or multi-component intervention to be tested, including elements of the intervention, proposed methods for assessing fidelity of intervention delivery and intervention performance, time duration of delivery (for clinician-provided interventions) or participant practice (for group or individual/home settings), and frequency of delivery or practice.</li><li>A description of the required training and/or licensure/credentialing of individuals providing the intervention across proposed site(s) if necessary.</li><li>A description and justification for assessments, including clinical, laboratory, physiological, behavioral, patient-centered, or other outcomes.</li><li>Use of patient-reported outcomes, including those available through the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), NIH Toolbox, and Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (NeuroQoL), as well as nontraditional data collection approaches (e.g., telephone, mobile devices, or web-based systems) need to be described. A description of the laboratory evaluations (as appropriate) and plans to implement and monitor Good Clinical Practices (GCP), Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), as appropriate, should be provided.</li><li>Investigators should utilize instruments validated in multiple languages representing the diversity of their participant population.</li><li>A description of the commitment to engagement of the clinical community that will play a critical role in the recruitment, retention, and overall conduct of the clinical trial, including how this clinical trial will be prioritized in the context of other overlapping clinical research.</li><li>Discussion of potential challenges expected in implementing the trial and how these might be overcome.</li><li>A timeline, which could be provided as a table or graph, for reaching important study milestones such as: (a) obtaining regulatory approval of the final protocol, (b) establishing agreements with participating partners, if relevant, (c) finalizing the study procedures and training participating clinical site staff, and (d) starting enrollment and completing all subject follow-up and data collection activities.</li><li>A description of the strategy for timely publication and dissemination of results.</li><li>Description of a future clinical trial: a concise summary of the proposed subsequent fully powered trial, including the study design (efficacy, effectiveness, or pragmatic) and how the proposed multi-site feasibility study will inform the design of that trial.</li><li>Investigators should check <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/#/">https://reporter.nih.gov/ </a>and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a> to provide justification that the work proposed is not duplicative of completed or ongoing trials. Applicants should not propose work that duplicates other feasibility studies already funded or other trials that are underway using a similar intervention in a similar population.</li><li>For applications that propose the use of an app or clinical decision support software, applicants must consult with their Institutional Review Board to determine whether the approach may qualify as a medical device. If so, or if in doubt, applicants should contact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to applying to determine whether an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application is necessary for the proposed clinical research (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-decision-support-software">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/your-clinical-decision-support-software-it-medical-device</a>).</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Letters of Support</strong>:</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Letters of support from clinicians or clinical department chairs whose support is necessary to the successful conduct of the trial should be provided from all participating sites or community organizations.

Investigators are encouraged to review NCCIH Policy: Study Accrual and Retention for Human Subject Research (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/policies/nccih-policy-study-accrual-and-retention-for-human-subject-research).</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Applicants must provide strong evidence of the availability of appropriate institutional resources and suitable patient populations. Documentation of the availability of eligible participants must be provided. The application must provide relevant information that addresses the feasibility of recruiting a diverse sample of eligible participants to demonstrate feasibility of meeting the NIH requirements for a representative sample in the future fully powered efficacy or effectiveness trial.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><i><strong>Section 3 - Protection and Monitoring Plans</strong></i></p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>3.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">In addition to the NIH application requirements for data and safety monitoring for clinical trials, NCCIH requires independent monitoring for research involving human subjects. Applicants should refer to NIH&#146;s policy on data and safety monitoring (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-038.html), as well as the NCCIH's Guidelines for Data and Safety Monitoring (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/policies/data-and-safety-monitoring-of-nccihfunded-clinical-research). The data and safety monitoring plan must explicitly describe plans to remotely monitor participant safety with appropriate safeguards to minimize risk. The Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC) or Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will have the responsibility to review interim and final data, recommend whether the protocol should be modified, and, at each meeting, recommend whether the study should continue or be terminated early. Thus, its ethical responsibilities to the participants, as well as to the integrity of the study, are of paramount importance to NCCIH. The IMC/DSMB will meet in person or by phone at least twice a year. To avoid conflicts of interest in peer review, applicants should not appoint IMC/DSMB members in advance of peer review, or even inquire about possible DSMB members.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><i><strong>Section 4 - Protocol Synopsis</strong></i></p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>4.5. Will the study use an FDA-regulated intervention?</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>4.5.a. If yes, describe the availability of Investigational Product (IP) and Investigational New Drug (IND)/Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) status.</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">If the proposed clinical trial will use a device, natural product (e.g.,botanicals, probiotics, and products marketed as dietary supplement), or drug, this attachment should describe correspondence from the FDA indicating whether the proposed study will require an IND or IDE application. Investigators should describe the process and the associated timeline that will be used to attain all FDA or other applicable regulatory agency approvals necessary to the conduct of the trial. For trials using an FDA-regulated product that requires an IND or IDE application, the grant application must include evidence regarding the outcome of a pre-IND meeting, or other evidence of communication with the FDA. If the protocol is being conducted under a non-U.S. regulatory agency, the applicant should submit a plan for attaining those regulatory approvals.

<p>Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.</p>

<p>Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at <a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm</a> and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).</p>
