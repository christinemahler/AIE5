		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>The goal of this initiative is to support action-oriented research that accelerates the translation of research to practice to address the overdose crisis. There remains an urgent need for research that advances the design of stigma-free patient-centered systems of care such that people who experience addiction can recover and sustain their recovery over the long-term. This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) solicits applications that address understudied areas of opportunity, particularly those that focus on fundamental barriers or facilitators to reducing overdose deaths at the individual, provider, organizational, community, or system levels. Projects should be in alignment with the overall goals of the HEAL Initiative, and should focus on replicable, scalable, equitable approaches for accelerating the movement of evidence-based and promising treatments into routine use. This NOFO invites phased applications to support projects for which preliminary or feasibility data is not available at the time of submission. This NOFO is a companion to <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-25-077.html">RFA-DA-25-077</a>, which solicits applications for which pilot data is available.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220632' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><strong>Background: HEAL Initiative&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The NIH HEAL Initiative: This study is part of the NIH&#146;s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for overdose, opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative">https://heal.nih.gov/</a>.</p><p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p><p>The goal of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support action-oriented research that accelerates the translation of research to practice to address the overdose crisis. There remains an urgent need for research to address understudied areas of opportunity, particularly addressing the fundamental barriers or facilitators to reducing overdose deaths at the individual, provider, organizational, community, or system levels.&nbsp;High priority areas are those that advance the goal of creating stigma-free patient-centered systems of care such that people who experience addiction can recover and sustain their recovery over the long-term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This NOFO is a companion to <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-25-077.html">RFA-DA-25-077</a> which also solicits applications relevant to the focus area. Applicants should note the difference between these NOFOs: RFA-DA-25-078 (this NOFO) solicits phased awards, which are most appropriate for projects that require 1-2 years for preparatory work such as collecting pilot data; obtaining and integrating existing data sets; building stakeholder engagement; developing, adapting, and testing the feasibility of key components of interventions or implementation strategies; building necessary infrastructure to support a larger trial (e.g., clinical alerts; recordkeeping systems); or similar activities upon which the subsequent phase would be dependent. Phased awards do not require pilot or feasibility data at the time of submission. Awards made under <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-25-078.html">RFA-DA-25-078</a> (this NOFO) may transition to the second (R33) phase to conduct a larger study upon successfully meeting relevant milestones in the R61 phase of the project. In contrast, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-25-077.html">RFA-DA-25-077</a> solicits applications that already have relevant preliminary, pilot, or feasibility data and are prepared to launch a larger study immediately upon award.&nbsp;</p><p>Proposed research under this NOFO must move beyond descriptive studies that enumerate factors that facilitate or impede the delivery of high-quality, effective addiction treatment services. Rather, applications should seek to develop and test systematic strategies for equitably improving the quality of care for people who experience addiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Applications should attend to methods to accelerate the translation of insights generated by the proposed research into practice. Methods such as implementation science, hybrid implementation/effectiveness trials, and dissemination research are critical tools for achieving this acceleration. Applications must be innovative and should not focus on replicating previous findings. Key elements that must be considered in all applications include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Meaningful engagement of relevant practitioners and community stakeholders in study conceptualization, design, execution, and interpretation.&nbsp;</li><li>Potential scalability of the proposed intervention, including perspectives of prospective payers should the proposed intervention prove to be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Sustainability of the proposed intervention should it prove to be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Health disparities and inequities and the relevance to the interventions or services being studied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Perspectives of patients or recipients of the services or interventions being studied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Proposed projects must address services related to the treatment of and/or recovery from opioid use or stimulant use disorder. Applications may also propose to explore issues relevant to the intersection of opioid or stimulant misuse/use disorders and pain. Applications that focus solely on primary prevention or opioid prescribing will not be considered responsive to this NOFO. Applicants interested in primary prevention and opioid prescribing should respond to other relevant HEAL NOFOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Studies may take place in a variety of settings including those in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, general and specialty healthcare, criminal justice, social and human services, pain clinics, pharmacies, workplaces, and community settings. Applicants are encouraged to consider nontraditional service delivery settings when these could potentially broaden the reach of evidence-based services to &nbsp;populations and other groups that have historically experienced challenges in access to addiction services.&nbsp;</p><p>This NOFO is a companion to <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-25-077.html">RFA-DA-25-077</a>. These NOFOs solicit applications relevant to translating research to practice for the prevention of overdose and the treatment of and recovery from opioid and stimulant addiction. Periodically, additional Notices of Special Interest (NOSIs) may be released by the NIH and published in the NIH guide identifying specific high priority areas of interest relevant to these NOFOs. In addition to areas of interest specified by such NOSIs, effectiveness, services, or implementation questions relevant to treatment of opioid use or stimulant use disorder and recovery support are of general interest. Examples of specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Provider, organizational, community, or system-level interventions that seek to enhance uptake of evidence based practices;&nbsp;</li><li>Studies that test novel and efficient service delivery models for opioid use disorder (OUD) and other comorbid medical and mental conditions;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Studies that seek to identify, develop, test, evaluate, and/or refine strategies to disseminate and implement evidence-based practices (e.g. behavioral interventions; prevention, early detection, diagnostic, treatment and disease management interventions; quality improvement programs) into public health, clinical practice, and community (e.g., workplace, school, place of worship) settings to address opioid or stimulant use and comorbid medical and mental conditions, including pain;&nbsp;</li><li>Approaches that enhance the quality, effectiveness, affordability, or utilization of existing treatments for OUD and comorbid medical or mental conditions, including pain;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Studies that address novel research questions that would otherwise not be addressed by programs or infrastructure supported through other funders (e.g., Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA),&nbsp;settlement funds, private funders, etc.);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Studies that seek to understand major changes or variations in the service delivery environment that may facilitate or impede the delivery of effective, high-quality, patient-centered services;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Projects that seek to understand circumstances and test strategies to stop or reduce (i.e., &#147;de-implement&#148;) the use of interventions that are ineffective, unproven, low-value, or harmful in efforts to demonstrably free up resources and then implement a high-value evidence-based practice</li><li>Strategies that seek to improve quality, timeliness, and utility of data to inform and support real-time proactive responses within systems and in cross-system collaborations;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Multi-level intervention designs that tackle multiple barriers to or facilitators of access to evidence-based services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Additional high priority topics may periodically be solicited under this NOFO through one or more NOSIs, published in the <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/funding/searchguide/index.html#/">NIH Guide</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This NOFO will not support applications that seek to develop and test the efficacy of novel addiction treatments or similar clinical interventions or new prevention interventions.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><i><strong>Phases of the Award &amp; Milestones&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">This funding opportunity uses a R61/R33 Exploratory/Developmental Phased Award mechanism. Support will be provided for up to 6 years, which includes initial support of up to 2 years of the R61 phase, followed by up to 5 years of support for the R33 phase upon successfully meeting R61 milestones.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">This mechanism is provided to facilitate research for which preliminary data is not available, including high risk/high reward research. However, even for high risk/high reward research, applicants must provide a clear vision for how the research would progress if successful. The R61 phase is a planning phase that can be for up to two years and will support activities that demonstrate feasibility. It is expected that work during this phase will largely focus on issues related to (1) collecting feasibility or pilot data for a clinical trials, (2) stakeholder engagement to ensure buy-in, sustainability, scalability, etc; (3) testing hypotheses for which preliminary data is not otherwise available; or (4) demonstrating ability to access key datasets or build critical infrastructure. Applications must delineate milestones that signify the completion of major elements necessary to support a larger scale project in the second phase (e.g., successful piloting of an intervention or intervention component; accessing or improving timeliness of a specific dataset; establishing Memoranda of Understanding [MOU] with key stakeholders, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">For transition to the R33 phase, recipients must submit the transition package no less than 75 days before the completion of the R61 phase. The transition plan should include the R61 progress report describing in detail the progress towards the R61 milestones and a description of how research proposed for the R33 phase will be supported by the completion of the R61 phase milestones. These materials will be evaluated by NIH program staff to determine if the milestones were met.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Transition to the R33 phases requires administrative review by NIH staff and is not guaranteed. R33 funding decisions will be based on the original R61/R33 peer review recommendations, successful completion of transition milestones, any proposed changes to the R33 research based on R61 findings, program priorities, and availability of funds. It is not expected that all applications will continue to the R33 phase.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pre-Application Consultation&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate NIH Program staff early in the application development process. This early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify NIH policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the HEAL initiative mission and intent of this NOFO.&#8239;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Non-responsive Applications</strong></p><p>The following applications will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Applications testing new clinical interventions to prevent or treat opioid addiction (i.e., drugs, devices, behavioral therapies). (Note applications may test adaptations of existing interventions, health services interventions, new recovery support interventions, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Applications that do not address effectiveness, services, or implementation questions relevant to the treatment of and/or recovery from opioid use or stimulant use disorder.&nbsp;</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Special Considerations</strong></p><p>National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drugabuse.gov%2Ffunding%2Fspecial-considerations-for-nida-funding&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cyvonne.walker%40nih.gov%7C2b30605ae50740cd31fb08dad6eab2e5%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C638058600752895551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=RZWNDnsvUK%2BgiMQdFmQN7h9cG6ADsnh51v0XvRnqG6k%3D&amp;reserved=0">Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards</a>. Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also opportunities to harmonize data within the broader NIH HEAL Initiative. Applicants selected for funding should expect to have a conversation with NIH program staff early in their project regarding high priority areas for potential harmonization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>NIH HEAL Requirements:</i> The NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative award recipients&nbsp;will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual NIH HEAL Investigators Meeting, as well as other activities.&nbsp;</p><p><i>HEAL Scientific Meeting Attendance:</i><strong> </strong>The <i>NIH HEAL Initiative&nbsp;</i>will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that <i>NIH HEAL Initiative&nbsp;</i>awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL Scientific Meeting, as well as other activities.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Clinical Trial Accrual: </i>This NOFO will support applications that include a series of milestones for completion of the clinical trial and provide contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances in attaining the milestones. Continuation of the award is conditional upon satisfactory progress, availability of funds, and scientific priorities of the HEAL Initiative. If, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, NIH will consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award. NIH retains the option of periodic external peer review of progress. NIH program staff will closely monitor progress at all stages for milestones, accrual, and safety.</span> Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://heal.nih.gov/funding/clinical-trials-policy">HEAL Policy for the Enrollment of Participants in Clinical Trials</a> for additional information.</p><p><strong>National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Areas of Specific Interest and NIMH-Specific Instructions</strong></p><p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is interested in applications to address relevant to priorities described in <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/goal-4-strengthen-the-public-health-impact-of-nimh-supported-research">Goal 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan for Research</a> and the following NOSIs to benefit people with OUD and co-occurring mental health conditions and/or suicide risk:</p><ul><li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-23-008.html">NOT-DA-23-008</a>&nbsp;Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) HEAL Initiative: Workforce Interventions to Improve Addiction Care Quality and Patient Outcomes</li><li><a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-23-007.html">NOT-DA-23-007</a>&nbsp;Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): HEAL Initiative: Opioid Use Disorder Care Pathways for Individuals with Histories of Exposure to Violence</li></ul><p><strong>For assignment to and funding consideration at NIMH, applicants should include &#147;NOT-DA-23-007" or &#147;NOT-DA-23-008&#148; (without quotation marks) in the Agency Routing Identifier field (box 4B) of the SF424 R&amp;R form. Applications that do not include this information will not be assigned to NIMH.</strong></p><p>All applications that propose clinical trials and that seek funding consideration at NIMH should follow the NIMH&#146;s experimental therapeutics approach to intervention development and testing (see <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml</a>). That is, the scope of work must include specification of targets/mechanisms and assessment of intervention induced changes in the presumed targets/mechanisms that are hypothesized to account for the intervention&#146;s outcomes. In this manner, the results of the trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and be informative regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the intervention was successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation).</p><p>NIMH is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. Accordingly, this NOFO encourages research studies that seek to reduce disparities for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons and other underserved groups.</p><p>NIMH encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and evaluation that takes into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders (e.g., service users, providers, administrators, payers) and the key characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) that are intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. This attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure the resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are acceptable to consumers and providers, the approaches are feasible and scalable in the settings where individuals are served, and the research results will have utility for end users.</p><p>NIMH encourages research on potentially scalable preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focuses on practice-relevant questions. Accordingly, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. When possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the NIMH-sponsored Mental Health Research Network (MHRN), electronic medical records, administrative databases, patient registries, institutions with Clinical and Translational Science Awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention approaches).</p>

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply-Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of&nbsp; a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>.</p>

The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code.

			 <a id='_bookmark220688' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><strong>Specific Aims:</strong></p><p>In the single page attachment allowed for the specific aims, applicants should provide an overview of the overarching research question of interest as well as include clearly marked headers for &#147;R61 Specific Aims&#148; and &#147;R33 Specific Aims&#148; with brief descriptions of the aims specific to each phase of the study.</p><p><strong>Research Strategy:</strong></p><p>The Research Strategy should be organized in a manner that will facilitate peer review. The body of the application should present an overview of the state of the science, current status and relevance of the proposed activities, and consideration of long-term sustainability and scalability of the proposed efforts.</p><p>The research strategy must clearly specify how the proposed project addresses effectiveness, services, or implementation questions relevant to other treatment of and/or recovery from opioid use or stimulant use disorder.</p><p>The following criteria should be addressed:</p><p><i><u>Significance: </u></i>The R61 and R33 should coherently address a single set of research questions and goals, with the R61 phase establishing feasibility and necessary data to support transition to the R33 phase. Given this tight integration, only one Significance section is needed.</p><p><i><u>Innovation: </u></i>Given this tight integration of the R61/R33 phases, only one Innovation section is needed. The Innovation section should explain how the proposed project, if successful, would lead to innovations that could help accelerate the translation of research findings to practice that would address the overdose crisis.</p><p>Preliminary data is <u>not</u> required <u>nor</u> is it required that teams have worked together previously. The phased award approach allows for earlier stage high risk/high reward projects. However, applications without preliminary data should have a strong scientific premise and establish a strong rationale for how solving the challenges outlined in the application would improve outcomes relevant to overdoses and/or opioid-related morbidity and mortality. NOTE: For early stage research involving new partnerships or where preliminary data is needed to support the premise of the larger study, these aspects of feasibility must be explicitly included as milestones for the R61 phase.</p><p><i><u>Approach: </u></i>The application should contain separate <i>Approach </i>sections for the R61 and R33 phases, as described below. It is not necessary to repeat any information or details in the R33 section that are described in the R61 section. Applications <u>must also include a Timeline &amp; Milestone plan</u> as an attachment as described in the SF424(R&amp;R) Other Project Information. The approach sections may reference this attachment and should limit what is repeated from this attachment, except where necessary for clarity.</p><p>The approach section must address the following elements in the phase most appropriate to the proposed study:</p><ul><li>Approach to engaging relevant practitioners and community stakeholders as partners (<i>Note: </i>Applicants must<u> include detailed plans for stakeholder engagement </u>as an attachment as described in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Other Project Information);</li><li>Considerations relevant to the sustainability of the proposed intervention should it prove to be successful;</li><li>Considerations relevant to the potential scalability of the proposed intervention, including perspectives of prospective payers should the proposed intervention prove to be successful;</li><li>Considerations relevant to health disparities and inequities and the relevance to the interventions or services being studied;</li><li>Considerations relevant to the perspectives of patients or recipients of the services or interventions being studied, where relevant.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:25px;"><i>R61 (Phase 1) Approach</i>:</p><p style="margin-left:50px;">The R61 phase of the award may be up to 2 years long. The R61 Approach section of the application must include milestones that are expected to be achieved by the end of the R61 phase. Milestones should be specific, quantifiable, and scientifically justified; they should establish the feasibility or empirical basis for pursuing the R33 phase of the study. <u>Milestones should not simply be a restatement of the specific aims for the R61 phase.</u></p><p style="margin-left:50px;">Examples of Milestones for the R61 Phase:</p><ul><li>Fully executed MOUs, letters of support, and data sharing agreements, as relevant to the goals of the study, from partnering departments, agencies or stakeholders</li><li>Demonstration of active engagement and partnership with key entities and stakeholders (e.g., formation of trans-department or trans-agency change teams)</li><li>If preliminary data was not included in original application, preliminary data demonstrating feasibility of R33 phase must be included.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:50px;">For applications where there is no preliminary data or where new partnerships are proposed, applicants should be especially attentive to proposing milestones that will help establish the feasibility of their proposed R33 project.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><i>R33, Phase 2 Approach</i></p><p style="margin-left:50px;">Although the Research Strategy for the R33 Phase is expected to be broad and flexible due to the nature of the explorative research in the R61 Phase, the research strategy for the R33 phase of the award should be described in enough detail for reviewers to evaluate the merit of this component of the application, based on anticipated results.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;">The proposed milestones for the R33 phase may be revised based on activities during the R61 planning phase. In the event of an award, the PD/PI and NIH staff will negotiate proposed changes and a list of appropriate milestones for each year of support.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;">The R33 phase may include a clinical trial if appropriate for the research questions and study design. Applications that propose a clinical trial in the R33 phase should include relevant information for the proposed clinical trial in the clinical trial attachment. As with milestones, the overall design of the R33 may be modified based on findings from the R61 phase, if appropriate. Any such modifications must be discussed in advance with NIH program staff and would include discussions of relevant changes to the proposed milestones.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Note:</u> The R33 phase of the proposed research may be up to 5 years, although applicants are encouraged to streamline the project period to complete the research as efficiently as possible. Applicants proposing R33 phases that exceed 4 years must provide a very strong justification.</p><p><strong>Letters of Support: </strong>Include letters of support/agreement for any collaborative arrangements, subcontracts or consultants. For activities to be conducted at an institution other than the applicant institution, a letter of assurance or comparable documentation, signed by the collaborator as well as the institutional officials, must be submitted with the application.</p><p>Applicants should include relevant letters of support from targeted systems or stakeholders. Where relationships with relevant systems or stakeholders do not exist or are not yet fully formalized, applicants should include formalizing these relationships as a milestone for the R61 phase.</p>
