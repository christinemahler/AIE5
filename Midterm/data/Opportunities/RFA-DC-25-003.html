			</div>
		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>This funding opportunity aims to support high risk clinical trials for the development of <i>in vivo</i> high-resolution structural and functional imaging technologies for the living human inner ear. Proposed projects should focus on improving the resolution of current imaging techniques or developing new imaging techniques that can visualize inner ear structures <i>in vivo</i> with significantly greater detail and accuracy than currently possible. Structural and functional aspects, including visualizing dynamic elements, are important to developing new and improved techniques. Projects may also focus on developing new imaging probes or contrast agents that can enhance visualization of the inner ear structures. Research supported in response to this funding opportunity is expected to significantly advance the ability to visualize auditory and vestibular components, such as hair cells, otoliths, membranes, ions, and vasculature, in detail in awake patients in a clinical setting using non-invasive techniques. To achieve this goal, a multidisciplinary team approach that takes advantage of the expertise of each team member is highly encouraged. Studies in humans must be proposed to develop,&nbsp;advance, or test the needed technology. Any intermediate studies must articulate a clear path of the proposed methodology to application in awake humans or define the limitations and the usefulness in anesthetized humans.&nbsp;</p><p>This funding opportunity supports a cooperative agreement between NIDCD and the recipient to support a clinical trial that meets ANY of the following criteria: requires FDA oversight, is intended to formally establish efficacy, or has potentially higher risks to participants.&nbsp;</p><p>These investigator-initiated clinical trials are perceived to benefit from close interaction, oversight, and guidance resulting from a cooperative agreement.</p><p>Only one clinical trial may be proposed per application submitted to this funding opportunity.</p><p>Low risk clinical trials not meeting any of the criteria above are referred to the companion <i>In Vivo</i> High-Resolution Imaging for Inner Ear Visualization (R01 - Clinical Trial Optional) <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-25-005.html">RFA-DC-25-005</a>.</p><p>Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact the scientific/research contact, prior to submission, to ensure this is the correct NOFO for their proposed research.</p>

			</div>
		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>To investigate solutions to problems directly relevant to individuals with deafness or disorders of human communication in the areas of hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, and language. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) supports research and research training, including investigation into the etiology, pathology, detection, treatment, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes, primarily through the support of basic and applied research in anatomy, audiology, biochemistry, bioengineering, epidemiology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, the neurosciences, otolaryngology, psychology, pharmacology, physiology, psychophysics, speech-language pathology, and other scientific disciplines. The NIDCD supports: (1) Research into the evaluation of techniques and devices used in diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes; (2) research into prevention and early detection and diagnosis of hearing loss and speech, voice, and language disorders and research into preventing the effects of such disorders by means of appropriate referral and rehabilitation; (3) research into the detection, treatment, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes in the elderly population and its rehabilitation to ensure continued effective communication skills; and (4) research to expand knowledge of the effects of environmental agents that influence hearing or other communication processes.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220473' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage cooperative agreement applications to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders (NIDCD) for investigator initiated high-risk clinical trials for <i>in vivo</i> imaging of the inner ear with high-resolution structural and functional imaging with the goal of advancing interventions into standard clinical care through well-designed and well-implemented clinical trials. This NOFO is specifically for clinical trials that meet ANY of the following criteria: requires FDA oversight, is intended to formally establish efficacy (phase III), or has potentially higher risks to participants. Clinical trials not meeting any of the criteria above are referred to the companion In Vivo High-Resolution Imaging for Inner Ear Visualization (R01 - Clinical Trial Optional)<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-25-005.html"> RFA-DC-25-005</a>.<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-24-004.html">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> The inner ear is a complex and delicate sensory organ responsible for hearing and balance. The anatomy of the human inner ear, including the small size of the sensory structures and their deep location within the temporal bone, poses significant challenges for imaging this organ. While various imaging modalities exist, none currently provide sufficient resolution to fully visualize the inner ear structures, nor do technologies exist that produce images in sufficient detail for fine-grade distinctions of inner ear components in living human tissue. Such imaging is needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of inner ear disorders.</p><p>While NIDCD has a significant investment in human post-mortem tissue to study the cochlea and vestibular system, detailed, non-invasive imaging in living humans has been severely impeded due to the limitations of current technology. These restrictions have seriously hampered progress in understanding pathology of the organs of hearing and balance in humans. The critical need to relate findings from animal models to human ear disorders, and for formulating specific diagnoses and treatment plans through the detailed visualization of the human inner ear has been emphasized in both a past NIDCD workshop &#147;Visualizing the Human Inner Ear&#148; (<a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/research/workshops/visualizing-human-inner-ear-workshop/2019/summary">https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/research/workshops/visualizing-human-inner-ear-workshop/2019/summary</a>) as well as the current NIDCD Strategic Plan for 2023-2027 (<a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plans">https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plans</a>). In addition, in 2023,&nbsp;NIDCD&nbsp;</span>issued a Request for Information (RFI) inviting input regarding NIDCD&#146;s support of non-invasive imaging in humans (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DC-23-004.html">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DC-23-004.html</a>).&nbsp;</span>Throughout these activities, the need for high-quality, high-resolution imaging of the human inner ear was a strong and recurrent theme. For example, an improvement in imaging resolution of five- to tenfold may allow scientists and clinicians to see many structures&mdash;including endocochlear or endovestibular structures&mdash;in sufficient detail, to inform clinical decision-making.</span> Visualizing the inner ear at a resolution necessary for unequivocal diagnoses in the clinician&#146;s office, understanding the mechanisms underlying hearing and balance disorders, and developing and guiding treatments, including gene therapy, will directly support NIDCD&#146;s scientific mission and improve human health.</p><p>Some examples of how advanced imaging could inform clinical management:</p><ul><li>Distinguishing between&nbsp;M&#x00e9;ni&#x00e8;re&#146;s disease and&nbsp;</span>vestibular migraines, which can present in similar ways, but require different treatments. In the case of the former, surgical ablation can help whereas that same procedure could exacerbate vestibular migraines.</span></li><li>Identifying the correct patient cohort as candidates for future inner ear gene therapies.</span></li><li>Determining the accuracy and targets of intracochlear treatments including the delivery of gene therapy.</span></li><li>Measuring the location and realignment of otoconia during canal repositioning treatments, such as the Epley maneuver for treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).</li><li>Improving placement of cochlear and vestibular implants.</span></li><li>Understanding blood vasculature changes and their relation to inner ear diseases.</span></li><li>Understanding the underlying molecular basis of inner ear diseases.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Scope:</strong> Applications responsive to this announcement include, but are not limited to, the following general topics:</p><p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">1. <u>Development of new non-invasive imaging techniques:</u> Projects may focus on developing new, <i>in vivo</i> imaging modalities or novel imaging technologies to provide high-resolution, three-dimensional in vivo imaging of inner ear structures.</p><p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">2. <u>Improvement of current imaging techniques:</u> Projects may focus on developing new hardware or software tools to improve the spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, or contrast of images from existing imaging techniques, such as micro-CT (computed tomography), OCT (optical computed tomography), super-resolution microscopy, photoacoustic imaging,&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) including high-strength MRI, and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Projects may also explore new methods for image reconstruction or image processing that can enhance the resolution of existing imaging techniques.</p><p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">3. <u>Development of novel imaging probes or contrast agents:&nbsp;</u>Projects may focus on developing new imaging probes or contrast agents that can specifically target and visualize human inner ear structures for high-resolution spatial and functional imaging. Such probes may include, but are not limited to, new nanoparticle-based imaging agents, genetically encoded fluorescent probes, or contrast agents that can selectively bind to human inner ear tissues.</p><p style="margin-left:13.5pt;">4. <u>Translating technology to the clinic</u>: Projects may focus on translating the developed imaging technologies to be used in a clinical setting. This may include developing new imaging devices that can be used in the clinic or performing clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the imaging techniques in animals and humans.</p><p>Some specific targets of opportunities for applications could include, but are not limited to, those listed below:</p><ul><li>Differentiating soft tissue from bone in the inner ear</li><li>Visualizing blood vasculature and blood flow in and around the inner ear, and changes to the blood flow patterns</li><li>Imaging the inner ear at cellular and subcellular levels</li><li>Distinguishing air from bone in the human inner ear</li><li>Dynamic movements of inner ear components</li><li>Physiology of inner ear functions</li><li>Detailed images of features such as hair cells, otoliths, membranes, ions</li><li>Determining the precise location of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia)</li></ul><p>The NIH defines a clinical trial as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes. This funding opportunity is specifically intended for clinical trials that meet ANY of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Requires FDA oversight such as those requiring Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications</li><li>Have higher risks to participants, for example:<ul><li>Involve a non-routine intervention</li><li>Involve utilization of unlicensed product/device</li><li>Involve utilization of a licensed product/device for an unapproved indication</li></ul></li><li>NIH defined Phase III Clinical Trial:<ul><li>An NIH-defined Phase III clinical trial is a broadly based prospective Phase III clinical investigation, usually involving several hundred or more human subjects, for the purpose of evaluating an experimental intervention in comparison with a standard or controlled intervention or comparing two or more existing treatments. Often the aim of such investigation is to provide evidence leading to a scientific basis for consideration of a change in health policy or standard of care. The definition includes pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions given for disease prevention, prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>Only one clinical trial may be proposed per application. Drug, biologic, or device interventions require applicants to provide documentation from the FDA (see Section 4.5 of PHS Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information).</p><p>Clinical trials that do not involve FDA oversight, are not intended to formally establish efficacy (may inform subsequent studies but are not aimed or sufficiently powered to directly change health policy or standard of care), and where the risks are no more than the potential risks encountered in routine medical care or procedures are referred to the companion In Vivo High-Resolution Imaging for Inner Ear Visualization (R01-Clinical Trial Optional) <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-25-005.html">RFA-DC-25-005</a>.</p><p><strong>Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO:</strong></p><p>Studies that are not responsive to this NOFO and will NOT be reviewed include the following:</p><ul><li>Applications that do not address scientific mission areas of the NIDCD</li><li>Low-risk clinical trials not meeting any of the criteria above&nbsp;</li><li>Applications that propose more than one clinical trial</li><li>Applications identified as a clinical trial that do not include a series of milestones for completion of the clinical trial and provide contingency plans should there be delays in attaining them</li><li>Applications that do not address the required five points in the Research Strategy</li></ul>

			 <p><strong>Applicant Organizations</strong></p>

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply- Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>

The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code.

	<ul>
		<li><a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11176">NATO Commercial and Government Entity (NCAGE) Code</a> &ndash; Foreign organizations must obtain an NCAGE code (in lieu of a CAGE code) in order to register in SAM.</li>

<p><strong>Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PD(s)/PI(s))</strong></p>

<p>All PD(s)/PI(s) must have an eRA Commons account. &nbsp;PD(s)/PI(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in eRA Commons. If the PD/PI is also the organizational Signing Official, they must have two distinct eRA Commons accounts, one for each role. Obtaining an eRA Commons account can take up to 2 weeks.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220576' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.</p>

<p>ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain &#147;applicable clinical trials&#148; on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (<a href="https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/">https://register.clinicaltrials.gov</a>). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm</a></p>

<p>Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.</p>

<p>Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at <a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm</a> and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).</p>

<p>Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).</p>
