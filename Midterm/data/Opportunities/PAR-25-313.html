			 <a id='_bookmark221358' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>The overall purpose of the NIH Research Career Development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. Candidates should review the different career development (K) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. More information about Career programs may be found at the&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=41159">NIH Research Training and Career Development&nbsp;</a> website.</p><p>&nbsp;The goal of the NCI Pathway Award (K99/R00) is to help postdoctoral researchers complete needed, mentored training and transition in a timely manner to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. The K99/R00 award is intended to foster the development of an independent research program that will be competitive for subsequent independent funding and that will help advance the mission of the NCI. Candidates must have no more than 6 yearsof postdoctoral research experience at the time of the initial or the subsequent resubmission or revision application. The K99/R00 award is intended for individuals who require at least 12 months of mentored research and career development (K99 phase) before transitioning to the R00 award phase of the program. Consequently, the strongest candidates will require, and will propose, a well-conceived plan for 1&ndash;2 years of substantive mentored research and career development that will help them become competitive candidates for tenure-track faculty positions and prepare them to launch robust, independent research programs. <i>An individual who cannot provide a compelling rationale for at least one year of additional mentored research experience and career development at the time of award is not a strong candidate for this award.</i></p><p>Individuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply to the NCI K99/R00 program. If a candidate achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a K99 award is made, neither the K99 nor the R00 award, will be made. The K99/R00 award will provide up to 5 years of support in two phases. The initial (K99) phase will provide support for up to 2 years of mentored postdoctoral research training and career development. The second (R00) phase will provide up to 3 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during the K99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. The two award phases are intended to be continuous in time. Therefore, although exceptions may be possible in limited circumstances, R00 awards will generally only be made to those K99 PDs/PIs who accept independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions by the end of the K99 award period.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark221359' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><i>Additional Information for </i>Clinician<i>-Scientists</i>: For the purposes of this program, physician-scientists include individuals with an MD, DO, DDS/DMD, DVM/VMD, or nurses with research doctoral degrees who devote the majority of their time to biomedical research. The K99/R00 is intended for those physician-scientists who already have substantial research training and are dedicated to initiating a strong, research-intensive career as physician-scientists. The K99/R00 program is designed to facilitate a timely transition of outstanding physician-scientists from mentored, research positions to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions, and to provide independent NIH research support during the transition. Individuals who need a longer period of mentored career development before they are prepared to begin the transition to research independence should consider the K08 or K23 program (see: <a href="https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/career-development">K Kiosk</a>).</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">NIH defines a clinical trial as "A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html">NOT-OD-15-015</a>).</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">NIH not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. These studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. By addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. NIH also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. NIH thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><br><strong>Responsive candidate&#146;s position titles and scientific scope</strong><br>Some examples of candidate&#146;s position title that may be appropriate for this NOFO include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><ul><li>Postdoctoral Fellow</li><li>Postdoctoral Researcher</li><li>Research Fellow</li><li>Staff Scientist</li><li>Instructor</li></ul><p>The proposed NCI K99/R00 project should be highly relevant to NCI&#146;s mission, including studies on cancer biology, cancer prevention, cancer treatment, diagnosis and prognosis, cancer control, population sciences, survivorship, and outcomes research and other approaches related to cancer research.

			 <a id='_bookmark221501' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><h4>Transition to the Independent Phase</h4><p>Transition from the mentored phase to the independent phase is intended to be continuous in time and, except in unusual, extenuating circumstances, &nbsp;NCI will not extend the K99 phase beyond the 2-year limit. NCI may, at their discretion, make exceptions to this time limitation when individuals have been invited for faculty job interviews, but final decisions have not yet been made by the potential R00 institution or, rarely, because of unusual, extenuating circumstances. To activate the independent phase of the grant, individuals must have been offered and accepted a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position (or equivalent) by the end of the K99 project period.</p><p>An eligible R00 institution will have appropriate infrastructure to support the proposed research program and a history of external research funding. K99 recipients are free to apply for independent phase positions within the NIH intramural research program (IRP). However, should the individual accept such a position in the IRP, the independent phase of the award will not be activated. This is because NIH intramural scientists are supported directly by NIH intramural funds and are not eligible for NIH extramural grant awards. Eligibility of for-profit organizations for the R00 phase depends on the nature of the appointment, and the ability of the PD/PI to conduct independent research and apply for NIH R01 or R01-equivalent research grants. PIs are encouraged to discuss job offers at for-profit organizations with NCI Program staff well in advance of accepting such an offer.</p><p>To avoid potential problems in activating the independent phase, recipients are strongly encouraged to contact their NCIprogram director as soon as plans to apply for and, assume an independent position develop, and not later than 6 months prior to the termination of the K99 phase of the award.</p><p>At that time, individuals should discuss plans for transition to, and application for, the R00 phase with their NCI program director. The application for the R00 phase of the award should be submitted no later than 2 months prior to the proposed activation date of the R00 award by the R00 phase recipient&nbsp;organization.</p><p>The independent phase institution will submit an application on behalf of the candidate for the R00 award using the <a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=22000">PHS 398 Application</a>. The R00 application must include:</p><ul><li>A new face page signed by the R00 phase institutional representative;</li><li>A new project description page (the project summary or abstract should be updated to reflect current plans for the R00 phase);</li><li>Detailed budget pages for a non-modular budget;</li><li>Biographical sketches for the PD/PI and any other Key Personnel;</li><li>A new Resources page;</li><li>A brief description of progress made during the K99 phase that will serve as the Final Progress Report for the K99 phase;</li><li>An updated research plan (the specific aims should be updated to reflect current plans for the R00 phase and the updated research plan should be briefly described in less than 5 pages);</li><li>Updated Protections for Human Subjects and Inclusion of Women, Minorities and Individuals across the Lifespan (as appropriate);</li><li>Authentication of Key Biological and/or Chemical Resources (as appropriate);</li><li>Updated Vertebrate Animals (as appropriate);</li><li>Updated Biohazards (as appropriate); and</li><li>A new checklist.</li></ul><p>These materials should be sent directly to NCI. The original application plus one copy (preferably in PDF format) are to be mailed (or e-mailed) to the NCI Financial or Grants Management contact person &nbsp;listed in the Notice of Award. The R00 application will be evaluated by NCI &nbsp;Program staff of the awarding component for completeness and appropriateness to the program.</p><p>Two additional documents are included with the R00 application. A letter from the R00 Department or Division Chairman must be submitted that describes the R00 institution&#146;s commitment to the candidate and plans for their career development (see below). If not already provided, the final evaluation statement by the K99 phase mentor, must be provided.</p><p>In addition to space, facilities, resources, and other support needed to conduct the proposed research, the sponsoring institution must provide protected research time (minimum of 9 person-months or 75% of the candidate&#146;s full time professional effort) at least for the duration of the R00 award. The start-up package and other institutional support must be described in detail and must be comparable to that given to other faculty recently hired into tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. Institutions must provide a startup and salary package equivalent to that provided to a newly hired faculty member who does not have a grant; R00 funds may not be used to offset the typical startup package or to offset the usual institutional commitment to provide salary for tenure-track (or equivalent) assistant professors who are hired without grant support. &nbsp;The R00 sponsoring institution must describe the candidate&#146;s academic appointment, bearing in mind that it must be tenure-track assistant professor (or equivalent), and confirm that the appointment is not contingent on the transfer of the award to the institution. The R00 phase institution must describe how the recipient&#146;s ability to apply for and secure independent research grant (R01) support &nbsp;will be fostered and supported during the R00 phase of the award.</p><p>The R00 award requires that a minimum of 9 person months (75% of the candidate&#146;s full time professional effort) be devoted to research activities. Consequently, teaching, clinical duties and other non-research activities should be minimal during the R00 award period. NCI staff may review start-up packages and other commitments between the institution and candidate prior to activating the independent phase of the award. It is suggested that the applicant and/or the hiring institution discuss the institutional commitment with the relevant NCI Program Director prior to &nbsp;finalizing the offer. &nbsp;NIH will not activate the independent phase if the institutional commitment is deemed inadequate. Recipients who are approved to transition will receive a Notice of Award reflecting the new R00 grant mechanism, the dollar amount, and the new recipient organization (if applicable).</p><p>The K99/R00 award is intended to facilitate successful transition to independence. Consequently, a requirement for activation of the R00 phase is successful completion of this transition. K99 recipients are encouraged (but not required) to apply for independent positions at departments and institutions different from where they conducted their mentored research. It is important for all recipients, but especially so for those who intend to stay at the mentored phase institution for the independent phase, to provide a plan by which they will separate from their mentor and advance to independence. Recipients are also encouraged to include a plan and timeline for submitting an independent research grant application in a research area relevant to the mission of NCI.</p><p>Candidates who are not approved to transition will receive written notification from the awarding component communicating the rationale for the disapproval. This notification typically will be sent within 60 days of receipt of the R00 application.</p><p>Although the financial plans of NCI provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds.</p><h4>Termination of the K99 award phase</h4><p>If transition from the K99 phase at an extramural institution to the R00 phase occurs at the originally scheduled end date of the K99 award, then no specific steps to terminate the K99 award are necessary. If the transition at an extramural institution occurs prior to the scheduled end date, then a revised Notice of Award will be issued to terminate the K99 phase award. &nbsp;Carry-over of unspent funds from a partially completed year in the K99 phase into the R00 phase not &nbsp;permitted.</p>
