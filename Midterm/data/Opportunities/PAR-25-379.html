			</div>
		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>The purpose of this&nbsp;notice of funding opportunity (NOFO)&nbsp;is to support research on interventions to improve health in Native American populations. This includes 1) etiologic research that will directly inform intervention development or adaptations, 2) research that develops, adapts, or tests interventions for health promotion, prevention, treatment, or recovery, and 3) where a sufficient body of knowledge on intervention efficacy exists, research on dissemination and implementation that develops and tests strategies to overcome barriers to the adoption, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of effective interventions. Through this initiative, intervention and related research is sought to build upon community knowledge, resources, and resilience to identify and rigorously test culturally appropriate solutions to reduce morbidity and mortality.&nbsp;Interventions should be designed with a consideration for sustainability within the communities where they are tested, and have the flexibility to be readily adapted, disseminated, and scaled up to other communities where culturally appropriate. This NOFO is part of the&nbsp;Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) initiative, which also includes NOFOs using the R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant mechanism (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-380.html">PAR-25-380</a>) and the R34 Clinical Trial Planning Grant mechanism (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-378.html">PAR-25-378</a>). Research projects may address topics within the identified interests of any of the participating Institutes or Centers; projects are not limited to substance use and addiction research.&nbsp;</p><p>For the purposes of this NOFO, Native Americans include the following populations: Alaska Natives, American Indians (whose ancestral lands fall at least partially within the U.S. mainland border), and Native Hawaiians. The term &lsquo;Native Hawaiian&#146; means any individual any of whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area which now comprises the State of Hawaii.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220632' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><h4>Purpose</h4><p>The purpose of this&nbsp;notice of funding opportunity (NOFO)&nbsp;is to support research on interventions to improve health in Native American populations. This includes 1) etiologic research that will directly inform intervention development or adaptations, 2) research that develops, adapts, or tests interventions for health promotion, prevention, treatment, or recovery, and 3) where a sufficient body of knowledge on intervention efficacy exists, research on dissemination and implementation that develops and tests strategies to overcome barriers to the adoption, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of effective interventions. Through this initiative, intervention and related research is sought to build upon community knowledge, resources, and resilience to identify and rigorously test culturally appropriate solutions to reduce morbidity and mortality. Research projects may address topics within the identified interests of any of the participating Institutes or Centers.&nbsp;The inclusion of Native American investigators serving on the study teams or as the PD(s)/PI(s) is strongly encouraged.&nbsp;</p><p>For the purposes of this NOFO, Native Americans include the following populations: Alaska Natives, American Indians (whose ancestral lands fall at least partially within the U.S. mainland border), and Native Hawaiians. The term &lsquo;Native Hawaiian&#146; means any individual any of whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area, which now comprises the State of Hawaii.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>Despite tremendous strengths, Native Americans have highly disparate rates of disease across many health outcomes such as chronic disease, substance use and addiction, cancer, mental illness, and sexually transmitted diseases. These disease outcomes in many cases can be traced to socio-structural factors and social and environmental determinants of health such as poverty, unemployment, pollution, and poor access to health care in combination with unique factors impacting Native people, such as historical trauma. In the face of these structural challenges, resiliencies and strengths within Native communities and individuals have been drawn upon to improve health outcomes.</p><p>There is a significant need for research that identifies malleable targets for intervention, tests the impact of new or existing intervention approaches, and identifies best practices for dissemination and implementation of effective interventions. Interventions that are theoretically grounded and built upon Indigenous Knowledge (see: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/</a>) and empirical evidence are needed to promote health, to prevent and treat disease, and to support recovery. Given continued disparities in service access and quality, and in disease outcomes, additional efforts are needed to advance dissemination and implementation science relevant to Native communities. There is a need for research to identify, understand, and develop strategies for overcoming barriers to the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, tools, policies, and guidelines that support the health of Native populations.</p><p>Projects proposed should 1) Clearly identify a health or disease condition for which there is need for intervention and community support and engagement to address the problem, 2) Articulate a process for ensuring cultural appropriateness and/or recognition of community strengths and resiliencies, 3) Advance knowledge toward addressing the health or disease condition through etiologic research, prevention research, treatment or recovery research or dissemination and implementation research, and 4) Be designed for sustainability in the test communities and for dissemination and scale up to other communities as indicated. Interventions may address individual behaviors, social conditions, or environmental conditions related to a disease or disorder.</p><p>Research should be designed in such a way that there is a high probability that interventions delivered can be scaled and sustained if the intervention is found to be effective. To ensure sustainability of intervention designs and service delivery strategies tested, applicants should, whenever possible, partner with tribes/communities and localities that use existing programming funds (e.g., funding from CDC, SAMHSA, Indian Health Services, Medicaid, Medicare and other insurance providers, and other program funding as appropriate) to support evidence-based programs and leverage those resources as the foundation for building infrastructure.</p><p>Qualitative data (structured, semi-structured, open-ended, and observational) can be particularly useful for understanding unique factors related to risk and resilience processes, for refining interventions and measures, for interpreting intervention research findings, and for understanding challenges in dissemination and implementation of effective strategies. Qualitative research is also helpful for assessing community or tribal-level approval and commitment. Applicants may choose to incorporate qualitative or mixed-methods approaches, including talking circles, interviews, focus groups, or other methods.&nbsp;</p><p>This NOFO is part of the&nbsp;<strong>Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) initiative </strong>(see: <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/native-american-intervention">https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/native-american-intervention</a>). The initiative also includes <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-380.html">PAR-25-380</a>, which uses the Exploratory/Developmental Grant (R21) mechanism and covers similar scientific scope to this one and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-378.html">PAR-25-378</a>, which uses the Clinical Trial Planning Grant (R34) mechanism and is specifically scoped to support researchers for community-engaged intervention development and feasibility testing. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-378.html">PAR-25-378</a> may also be used for the development and piloting of protocols for future tests of intervention efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation. <u>Not all NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) participate in all three NOFOs</u>. Please speak with the Scientific Contact for the IC listed in Section VII below for the IC you wish to target to discuss which NOFO might be the best fit for your proposed project.</p><h4><strong>Additional Considerations for Proposed Research</strong></h4><p> Applicants are encouraged to consult<strong> American Indian and Alaska Native Research in the Health Sciences: Critical Considerations for the Review of Research Applications, </strong>which can be found at<strong> </strong></span><a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Critical_Considerations_for_Reviewing_AIAN_Research_508.pdf"> https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Critical_Considerations_for_Reviewing_AIAN_Research_508.pdf</span></a> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Coordination across projects</strong>. Although the studies supported by the IRINAH initiative will not use a common study protocol, investigators are expected to meet regularly as part of a network to participate in activities in support of advancing research on Native American health. Such activities could include participating in cross-cutting interest groups, sharing and discussion of measures, and developing collaborative publications and products. An annual meeting will be held of all investigators with optional attendance by community partners funded by the IRINAH initiative; monthly or bi-monthly phone calls will also be held. Locations of the annual meeting will vary depending on sites funded through the initiative. Project budgets should include costs for one or more study team members to attend the annual meeting.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Etiology Research.</strong> In describing research priorities, the National Congress of American Indians has stated that research must benefit Native people. This means that the research should have tangible benefits by informing strategies for increasing health equity or otherwise provide information that can be used by the community to make improvements. As such, the etiology research supported by this NOFO should have clear implications for improving the ability to intervene. Etiology research should only be proposed when it is intended to discover a more basic understanding or add nuanced clarification, which would be helpful in designing efficacious interventions.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Conceptions of Health.</strong> While the absence of a particular disease is a critical outcome, the concept of health within many Native American communities embodies wellness and is broader than the absence of disease. All four elements of life &mdash; physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual &mdash; are intricately woven&nbsp;together and interact to support a strong and healthy person. In this holistic perspective, illness results from imbalance and wellness from balance in these elements. For Native people who identify strongly with tribal or indigenous culture, working with traditional healers or engaging in traditional cultural practices may be a first step taken to address disease or improve wellness. For this announcement, investigators are encouraged to consider Native concepts of health and Native practices in the study of etiology, prevention, and treatment.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Community Engagement.&nbsp;</strong>The appropriate conduct of research with Native American populations has been widely documented; research must be conducted in a community-engaged manner, where the community has an equal voice as a research partner. The research should be consistent with community desires and informed by these at every step of the process. Community based participatory research (CBPR) approaches are one way to ensure appropriate engagement with communities in research and the cultural appropriateness of the intervention, study design and overall approach. Where communities desire to do so, researchers should incorporate a CBPR approach. Communities may choose to pursue approaches other than CBPR, and other forms of community-engaged research are acceptable for this NOFO. The community/tribe(s) must be appropriately involved in the study design and overall approach.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Culturally Appropriate&nbsp;Research.&nbsp;</strong>Native communities and experts on Native American research have made clear the importance of culture in addressing health outcomes. Investigators are encouraged to consider culturally unique etiological factors or targets for intervention, relying on culturally relevant theories to frame research, considering culturally specific world views and Indigenous Knowledge as they relate to the research approach and design, culturally sensitive research processes, and culturally appropriate measurement strategies and processes.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Strength-Based Focus. </strong>Since many communities place a high value on the strengths and resilience of Native peoples, investigators are encouraged to&nbsp;incorporate community/cultural strengths and resiliencies interventions. It is appropriate to consider community resilience in addition to the resilience of individuals.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Interventions. </strong>When studies involve prevention, treatment, or recovery interventions, the interventions must be consistent with community values. Interventions should be supported by theory or empirical knowledge, which can originate from Indigenous Knowledge or from culturally appropriate non-Native paradigms. Intervention studies may test traditional health, medical, and/or cultural practices independent of or in concert with practices that have been tested in research with non-Native populations. Intervention delivery should, whenever possible and scientifically or otherwise appropriate, employ individuals from the community. Such interventionists could include behavioral professionals, community health workers, counselors, nutritionists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or traditional healers. The IRINAH initiative aims to strengthen health across multiple Native populations. Applicants should plan to prepare intervention manuals and other potential dissemination activities if evidence for the intervention&#146;s effectiveness is compelling.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Beyond the Individual.</strong> Reflecting the importance of community, researchers should consider proposing studies that address community, institutional, familial, peer network, or other factors that directly influence health outcomes or that impact individual's abilities to enact health preserving practices. This could include testing multi-level intervention approaches or addressing and reporting on changes in known contextual influences while intervening to create individual level change. However, the interventions should not be so intensive or time-consuming that they would exceed the resources of the participants/community to participate or sustain the intervention. Please see the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework as one example (<a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/">https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/</a>).</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Clinical Trial Design Considerations.</strong> Investigators are encouraged to work with Tribal partners and communities to identify potential research designs that will provide robust evidence of intervention efficacy or effectiveness.&nbsp;Rigorous research designs are expected, but investigators are not required to conduct randomized controlled trials.and to ensure that they have appropriate statistical expertise on the study team to address any non-independence or other potential sources of bias in the study design.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">If participants are assigned to study arms, other potentially appropriate study designs with randomization include parallel group or cluster-randomized trials, individually randomized group-treatment trials, and stepped wedge group or cluster-randomized trials. When it is not possible to assign participants to study arms, alternative rigorous research designs that provide robust evidence of intervention effectiveness include, but are not limited to, multiple baseline or repeated measures designs, interrupted time series studies, or stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials in which all subjects receive the intervention.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">In these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation, particularly for small samples where traditional experimental randomization is not possible without impacts on bias or contamination.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"> <u>Investigators are strongly encouraged to review the NIH Clinical Trials definitions and policies (</u></span><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials.htm"> <u>https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials.htm</u></span></a> <u>)</u>. Applications that do not include all required documentation for clinical trials for review, but are determined to be clinical trials, may not be considered for funding.&nbsp;</span></p><h4>Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO</h4><p>The following types of studies are not responsive to this NOFO and will not be reviewed:</p><ul><li>Applications that propose research objectives that are not aligned with the mission of any of the participating ICs</li><li>Applications that do not propose community-engaged projects</li><li>Applications that do not propose research with Native Americans</li></ul><h4>Research Objectives</h4><p>Participating NIH ICs have identified priority research areas below. Applicants are encouraged to speak with IC representatives for technical assistance (see Agency Contacts in Section VII). Applicant organizations with limited research experience are strongly encouraged to develop applications in collaboration with research organizations.</p><p><u>Applicants should ensure that the IC they wish to target participates in the IRINAH NOFO to which they wish to submit. Applications that do not align with the missions of any of the participating ICs will be considered non-responsive.</u></p><p><strong>National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)</strong></p><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is interested in culturally appropriate etiology, prevention, treatment, recovery, implementation, and dissemination research focused on substance use among Native adolescents and adults. NIDA is interested in a wide array of substances including but not limited to nicotine, psychostimulants/methamphetamines, opioids, cannabis, synthetic drugs, and psychoactive prescription drugs. Research at the intersection of HIV and substance use, including research that incorporates HIV prevention and/or care, also is welcome. Investigators are encouraged to propose research in urban, rural, and reservation settings and research that utilize existing infrastructure, community resources, service systems (public and private), and health and wellness providers. NIDA also invites research on the essential components of prevention and treatment interventions (including putative treatment targets) to improve effectiveness, scalability, and personalization.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Special Considerations</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">NIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drugabuse.gov%2Ffunding%2Fspecial-considerations-for-nida-funding&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cyvonne.walker%40nih.gov%7C2b30605ae50740cd31fb08dad6eab2e5%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C638058600752895551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=RZWNDnsvUK%2BgiMQdFmQN7h9cG6ADsnh51v0XvRnqG6k%3D&amp;reserved=0">Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards</a>. Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.</p><p><strong>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</strong></p><p>Overall, Native Americans have higher rates of getting cancer and the lowest 5-year cancer survival rate of any subpopulation in the U.S. Poorer cancer survival rates have been attributed to many factors, including inadequate health care access, geographic isolation, later stage of detection, underutilization of treatment, and cultural barriers.</p><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is committed to eliminating cancer related disparities and is interested in applications that focus on individual, familial, and community interventions that inform and promote health equity along the cancer continuum, from prevention to early detection, treatment, follow-up care, through end-of-life research. It is important that researchers consider the structural context in which people live and develop feasible, acceptable, sustainable, and scalable interventions that can improve overall health and cancer outcomes. NCI is also interested in research seeking to understand the etiology of cancer, and implementation projects that build on the existing knowledge to improve cancer prevention and control outcomes.</p><p>NCI is not participating in the R34 Planning Grant NOFO (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-285.html"><u>PAR-23-285</u></a>). Please use this R01 mechanism to submit applications and incorporate aims that fit within the scope of&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-285.html"><u>PAR-23-285</u></a>&nbsp;into your R01 application as needed. For further clarification, please contact the NCI Scientific Staff listed in below. Applicants are encouraged to visit the <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/hdhe"><u>DCCPS website </u></a>for more information on health disparities priorities and agendas.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) supports research that tests culturally-appropriate and sustainable interventions to reduce cardiovascular, pulmonary, blood, or sleep-related disorders and associated morbidity and mortality across the lifespan. Interventions may address behaviors that adversely impact health and well-being, including but not limited to smoking, poor dietary behavior, physical inactivity, and poor sleep. Interventions that address health outcomes related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, blood, or sleep disorders, including but not limited to hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and iron-deficiency anemia are encouraged. In addition, strategies and/or interventions to accurately diagnose, treat, or prevent cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in women, including during the different stages of pregnancy, are of interest. Intervention strategies to promote the health of children including the prevention and treatment of early cardiometabolic risk factors are encouraged. Implementation research that evaluates proven modalities found effective in other populations that may be tested and evaluated in Native populations and methods to enhance the dissemination and use of evidence-based resources are additional areas of interest. Applicants are expected to include at least one social determinant of health in their applications (see NIH&#146;s PhenX Social Determinants of Health Assessments Collection).</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>National Institute on Aging (NIA)</strong></p><p>NIA supports mechanism-based intervention research to prevent, reduce, or eliminate health disparities and inequities over the life course, especially among older adults and people living with Alzheimer&#146;s disease and Alzheimer&#146;s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD). NIA encourages research on factors affecting health and longevity, such as cultural affiliation, socioeconomic and geographic inequality, gender differences, discrimination, and stress, among Native American&#8239;groups.&#8239;Applicants are encouraged to consider priorities outlined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/aging-strategic-directions-research/goal-health-disparities-adults"><u>NIA&#146;s strategic directions for health disparities research</u></a>&nbsp;and in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/milestones">AD+ADRD Research Implementation Milestone Database | National Institute on Aging</a>. In addition, applicants are strongly encouraged to consider how proposed activities might be informed by the four key levels of analysis related to health disparities research &ndash; environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological &mdash; with priority focus areas in each level as reflected within&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/osp/framework"><u>NIA&#146;s Health Disparities framework</u></a>. Similarly, NIA encourages applicants to draw upon the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/nih-stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development"><u>NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development</u></a>, which offers a framework to: (1) support development and testing of effective interventions that are defined by their principles and (2) ensure that efficacious interventions can be administered in the community or in health systems with fidelity to the intervention&#146;s principles.</p><p><strong>National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA)</strong></p><p>The National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) is interested in etiology, prevention, treatment, recovery, and health services research within Native American populations.

			 <a id='_bookmark220688' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><strong>Research Strategy</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Applicants must provide evidence that the research question addressed is relevant to and prioritized by the Native American community partners for the study and that the project, if completed successfully, can improve the health of one or more Native American communities. Applicants should clearly articulate how their research builds fundamental knowledge relevant to Native American health. NIH&#146;s mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to use that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Through this initiative, fundamental knowledge includes findings that may be specific to a Native American community or group of communities, even if the outcomes may not generalize broadly. Fundamental knowledge may also be defined as principles for community engaged research, or methodological innovations.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Applicants must demonstrate innovation in their proposed research. Some examples of the types of innovations that may be included are the use of Indigenous Knowledge (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/</a>), research capacity development, novel research design and analysis, novel approaches to community engagement and/or participant recruitment, research to address the cultural appropriateness of standard measures or develop new measures, determination of culturally/clinically meaningful effect sizes, or through the development or adaptation of interventions.</p><p><strong>Investigators</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Investigators, both those from research institutions and those who work with the community, must show relevant proficiency to conduct the proposed research, including proficiency for working with Native American partners and communities. Indications of proficiency might include research publications, efforts to build relationships and trust with communities, dissemination of information to Native American communities, personal engagement in community events, provision of training to communities, knowledge of community systems and settings, and leadership roles in the community. Productivity of community-based investigators may rely on a description of their proficiency in working within the community.</p><p><strong>Partnerships and collaborations</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">The community-researcher partnership must be documented in the Research Strategy section to describe the community's support for and involvement in development, design, testing, and dissemination of the study, including establishing a Community Advisory Board. If using CBPR research methods, these must be appropriately documented. The description of the community-research organization partnership must describe the scientific, logistic, and organizational responsibilities of each of the collaborators for each aspect of the proposed project. The application should also describe the history of the partners in collaborating on prior research projects, or other mutually beneficial activities, the mutual understanding and cooperation among the partners, procedures for resolving disagreements, and the relative contributions to the previous and current projects.</p><p><strong>Approach</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Given that prior research within Native communities is often limited, pilot/preliminary data from the community under study are not required. However, applicants are encouraged to provide such data if they are available. If not, applicants are encouraged to provide data on similar interventions that have been conducted in comparable populations or settings. Sources reflecting local knowledge that are not peer-reviewed or that are unpublished are acceptable when justified.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Whether or not preliminary data are included, the research is expected to be informed by a well-defined theory of change, logic model, or cultural source and associated hypotheses are expected. Research questions that have been addressed for other populations may still need to be specifically addressed for Native Americans if there is reason to believe that processes might operate differently for a Native American community or Native Americans more broadly. Appropriate justifications of scientific gaps areas must be provided in the applications, including, for example, the cultural adaptation of interventions or measures that have been used or validated with other populations. Justifications for the premise of the research can be established based on documentation from scientific and/or cultural sources.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Applicants must provide evidence of community support and of the feasibility of the planned research. As appropriate to the proposed project, applicants should provide evidence of their ability to recruit participants in each community involved in the study, to implement measurement and intervention protocols in the target population, to provide appropriate oversight, and to maintain high rates of retention throughout the intervention and follow-up period. Applicants should include a discussion of the study team&#146;s prior experience working with the study population, and with the measures and methods to be used or tested in the research.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">When the research involves intervention development, adaptation, or testing, the intervention (or the process of its initial development) must be described, including the theoretical and empirical evidence informing the intervention, the proposed mechanisms of action of the intervention, the health outcomes the intervention is meant to impact, and any relevant protective factors or risk factors that the intervention acts on or through for its hypothesized effects. When appropriate, the study should include plans for assessing fidelity of intervention and/or protocol implementation and/or plans for manualization or other standardization practices. The application must describe how the approach taken will support the future sustainability of the intervention, and any implications for implementing or disseminating the intervention if it is found to be effective in the future trial.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">For intervention testing, the application should describe and scientifically justify the nature of any comparison/control group (e.g., whether the comparison group will receive information only, minimal treatment, delayed intervention, or some other design). Applicants should consult with collaborating communities to discuss the appropriateness of the selected approach to the comparison group, as tribal leaders and community members may believe that comparison group members should receive something more than usual care. The study design, whether a randomized controlled trial or another type of design should be scientifically rigorous and well-justified.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Evidence of the expertise of the study team to analyze the data from the proposed design must be provided. Applications should address the appropriateness of the measures for the planned study sample and their psychometrics and/or validity. While many research measures have not been validated for Native people, they may be the only measures validated to assess constructs and thus may be an appropriate tool. Research projects may use existing measures or propose research to develop new measures that reflect culturally relevant constructs. The analytic plan should address the strengths and the limitations of the study design and/or datasets used, as well as issues such as missing data, Power estimation should consider both main effects and mediated effects when relevant and should consider clinically meaningful effect sizes.

Letters of support should describe the scientific, logistic, and organizational responsibilities of each of the collaborators for each aspect of the proposed project.

A copy of the current operational resolution(s) must be submitted with the application.</li><li>In recognizing that Tribal governments are legal sovereign nations, potential partners should be informed that tribes may seek ownership or control of all data and all biological samples; therefore, universities and other partners should be prepared to negotiate data sharing and biological sample sharing agreements with tribes/Tribal government(s) as appropriate. If such an agreement is in place the applicant(s) should provide the letter of such an agreement with the application. Letters of Support should also explicitly stipulate that Tribes agree to respond expeditiously to requests for approval of the protocol, protocol modifications, approval of abstracts for presentation to scientific meetings, and approval of manuscripts for submission for publication in scientific journals. The time required for approving each of these (protocol, abstracts, manuscripts): 1) must be proposed and stated within the resolution of support, 2) may differ for each of these activities, 3) may be modified by study investigators only in consultation with the tribal/community leadership, and 4) should identify an individual or entity within the tribe or community to whom a request for waiver of the time requirement can be directed if circumstances arise. PD/PI(s) and tribes/communities are expected to publish scientific papers, present at scientific conferences/associations/meetings; and may also be expected to develop fact sheets/materials for dissemination to the tribe/community.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:25px;">If the applicant(s) is working with communities, tribes/tribal governments then community/tribal resolutions of support, or equivalent documents, should accompany the application whenever possible. However, tribal resolutions and letters of support from community collaborators may be submitted as post-submission material up to 30 days before the study section meeting. The date of the study section meeting will be posted in eRA after submission. <strong>Note that this flexibility is NOT&nbsp;extended to letters of support from Key Personnel and consultants with academic or research organization affiliations.</strong> Letters of support from personnel with academic or research organization affiliations must be submitted with the application (on either October due date for non-AIDs applications or the January due date for AIDs applications listed in the Key Dates table above).</span></p>

<p>ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain &#147;applicable clinical trials&#148; on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (<a href="https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/">https://register.clinicaltrials.gov</a>). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm</a></p>

<p>Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.</p>

<p>Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).</p>

<p>Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).</p>
