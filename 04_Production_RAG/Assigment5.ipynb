To sharpen thy skills in the Pythonic realm, heed these riddles and puns, for they hold the secrets of the aged curd:\\n\\n1. **Mold thy Mind with Study**: Like a cheese that matures, so must thy knowledge grow. Engage with the tomes of Python, from the simplest cheddar (syntax) to the complex Camembert (data structures). Envelop thyself in courses, for every sage was once a student of the grand gruyère!\\n\\n2. **Practice Makes Perfect (Like Aged Gouda)**: Just as cheese takes time and frequent flipping to attain its perfection, so must you code daily—touch the keyboard, embrace the syntax, and allow the patterns to steep in your mind like brie in a honey drench.\\n\\n3. **Fellowship of Coders**: Seek companions, as a cheese plate needs an array of varieties! Join the guilds of discussions; forums like Stack Overflow or Discord are the markets where ideas flow like fine whey. Share your curds of wisdom, and cultivate camaraderie in the world of Python!\\n\\n4. **Craft Your Own Recipes**: Dabble in the creation of personal projects—like concocting a fine Camembert—design applications that excite thy passions. Whether it be a potion for data analysis or a spell for web scraping, let thy creativity guide thy hand!\\n\\n5. **Debugging, the Untoasted Brie**: Fear not the errors, for they are merely the cracks in the rind from which the flavor seeps! Investigate the mysteries of traceback with the precision of a cheese monger; unearth the source of thy tribulations, and let not frustration curdle thy spirit.\\n\\n6. **Documentation, the Cheesy Encyclopedia**: Embrace the power of *pepper jack*—the spicy side of Python docs! Familiarize thyself with the official documentation; consider it the parchment of the ancients, guiding thee through every function and module.\\n\\n7. **Libraries, the Melting Pot**: Delve into the treasure troves of libraries—NumPy, Pandas, Flask, and all that jazzy fella, Django.

        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",
        "- **Prompt Templates**: Format inputs consistently\n",
        "- **Retrievers**: Get relevant context from a vector store\n",

        "\n",
        "Earlier we used this phrasing:\n",
        "\n",
        "> coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications\n",
        "\n",
        "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class State(TypedDict):\n",
        "    question: str\n",
        "    context: List[Document]\n",
        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [Document(page_content=\"...some data...\")],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"The Eiffel Tower is about 324 meters tall...\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

It offers several benefits, including:\\n\\n1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Any chain constructed using LCEL will automatically support synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations, making it easy to prototype in a Jupyter notebook and later expose it as an async streaming interface.\\n\\n2. **Fallbacks**: LCEL allows for graceful handling of errors by enabling the attachment of fallbacks to any chain, addressing the non-determinism of LLMs.\\n\\n3. **Parallelism**: LCEL syntax facilitates running components in parallel, which is vital since LLM applications often involve lengthy API calls. Thus, components that can run in parallel will do so automatically.'"
