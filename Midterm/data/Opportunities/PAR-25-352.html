			</div>
		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p>The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to accelerate innovative drug and device therapies translation from discovery to early human studies. Studies appropriate for this NOFO will develop pharmacologic and neuromodulatory tools for basic and clinical research on mental health disorders; develop and validate tools (pharmacologic or neurostimulation) in support of experimental therapeutic studies of innovative candidates for mental disorders; and support early-stage human studies to rapidly assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of promising drug candidates/devices and new indications for novel Investigational New Drug (IND)-ready agents or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)-ready devices for the treatment of mental disorders. This NOFO encourages applications to advance the discovery, preclinical development, and proof of concept (PoC) testing of new, rationally based candidate agents and neurostimulation approaches to treat mental disorders, and to develop novel ligands and circuit-engagement devices as tools to further characterize existing or to validate new drug/device targets. Partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged.&nbsp;</p><p>This NOFO will also support applications proposing preclinical discovery of biotechnology products and biologics with potential as candidate therapeutics including, but not limited to, large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides), gene-based therapies (i.e., oligonucleotide- and viral vector-based), cell therapies, and novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies).</p><p>This NOFO supports a discrete, specified, circumscribed project to be performed by the named investigator(s) in an area representing his or her specific interest and competencies. Projects seeking support for a research program of multiple projects directed toward a specific major objective, basic theme, or program goal, requiring a broadly based, multidisciplinary, and often long-term approach should consider the companion NOFO <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-353.html">PAR-25-353</a></p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220473' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p>The intent of this NOFO is to encourage applications from academic, biotechnology, biomedical device industry, or pharmaceutical industry investigators interested in participating with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in a National Cooperative Drug/Device Discovery/Development Group (NCDDG) program. The objectives of this program are: to advance the discovery, preclinical development, early-stage human studies, and/or proof of concept testing of new, rationally based candidate agents or devices to treat mental disorders, and to develop novel ligands and novel brain circuit-modulatory technologies as tools to advance biological research on the function of genes, cells, biochemical pathways, distributed neural circuits, and neural oscillatory patterns implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of mental disorders, and as potential new therapeutics. Partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged. This program strongly encourages in-kind resource contributions of the partners within the NCDDG (e.g., biotechnology, pharmaceutical, or disease foundations).</p><p>Each NCDDG program should consist of a multidisciplinary team of scientists with appropriate expertise to further the development and evaluation of novel candidate agents or proposed biomedical devices. Scientists from both academia and pharmaceutical industry are encouraged to participate within an NCDDG; scientists from foreign institutions and NIH Intramural laboratories may participate in some aspects. It is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with industry and NIH via the NCDDG model will: 1) accelerate the discovery and development of new therapeutics for mental disorders; 2) increase the availability of pharmacologic and device-based research tools (including Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging agents) for basic and clinical research; 3) facilitate the development and validation of neurophysiological, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) measures to evaluate novel therapeutics for mental disorders; 4) increase the availability of new compounds, agents, and devices suitable for testing in humans; 5) facilitate the development and validation of new clinical measures or biomarkers suitable for use in human Proof of Concept (PoC) trials of novel therapeutics for mental disorders; and/or 6) develop and validate novel neurostimulation technologies and protocols for mental disorders.</p><p>The goal of the NCDDG program is not to duplicate or compete with the private sector but to complement and accelerate the development of research tools for new molecular and circuit targets implicated in mental disorders, and effective compounds, agents, and devices for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders, as well as core features of these illnesses, especially in areas of unmet medical need.</p><p><strong>Background and Research Objectives</strong></p><p>Significant advances in neuroscience, genetics, genomics, and related omics, behavioral neuroscience, together with technological developments (structural biology, <i>in silico </i>and high throughput screening, <i>in vivo </i>imaging methods), have provided a rich knowledge base for understanding pathophysiology, identifying new molecular targets for drug discovery, new circuit/oscillatory targets for device development, and developing rational pharmacotherapies and neuromodulation interventions for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. With the wealth of potential new drug/device targets, the opportunity exists to accelerate the process of target validation and medication discovery to make great strides toward novel and effective treatments for mental disorders.</p><p>A U01 application can include no more than a single Research Project. Applications proposing two or more Research Projects along with Scientific and/or Administrative Core components should respond to the companion NOFO utilizing the U19 mechanism (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-353.htmlhttps://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-353.html">PAR-25-353</a>)</p><p><strong>NIMH's Objectives and Interests for the NCDDG Program</strong></p><p>NIMH&#146;s objective for the NCDDG program is to support innovative, high impact research focused on the discovery of pharmacological agents selective for novel molecular targets and new neuromodulation devices targeting novel neural circuit and neural oscillatory targets with potential to prevent or reverse pathophysiological processes underlying mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, fragile x, autism, and other mental illnesses. Public-Private partnerships are particularly encouraged.</p><p>NIMH-relevant NCDDG research projects should focus on novel interventions, using either pharmacological agents or neuromodulation devices that interrogate a molecular, circuit or clinical target that is linked to a biological mechanism or pathophysiology of the proposed mental disorder.</p><p>The NIMH strongly encourages an experimental medicine approach to therapeutic development. This NOFO will support up through First-in-Human (FIH) for devices or Phase Ia or Ib trials for pharmacological agents. For these trials, studies are expected to assess the agent/device for 1) safety and tolerability, 2) target engagement, and 3) pharmacodynamic effects on relevant circuits or systems. Data resulting from Phase I trials in healthy controls and in the target patient population are expected to determine optimal clinical dosing and to establish feasibility for further testing in PoC and efficacy trials. Agents/devices should be sufficiently potent and selective for critical evaluation of target engagement and brain exposure. The agent/indication (if successful) should have a major, not merely incremental, impact on unmet medical need in psychiatric disorders. In support of this effort, NIMH recognizes the need for the timely development of new PET tracers for targets that are of interest for assessing target engagement/dose selection for clinical trials of novel therapeutics and for studies of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.</p><p>Consistent with NIMH&#146;s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, research projects directed towards ameliorating pathophysiology that is potentially more proximal to specific functional deficits (domains) than Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic entities are encouraged. Additional information about the RDoC approach can be found on the <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/index.shtml">RDoC website</a>. The testing of functional domains not included specifically in RDoC may also be considered, if well justified.</p><p>NIMH encourages applications ranging from ligand discovery and testing in preclinical assays through human Phase I studies of novel agents. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>An application that integrates machine learning (ML) tools, including human-in-the-loop ML (an ML model that requires researcher interaction), into the drug discovery process at any of its stages, from hit/lead identification to lead optimization.<ul><li>Use of generative ML models in de-novo design of drug chemical structures with desired properties</li><li>Ligand-based virtual screening and computational hit expansion following high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns</li><li>Use of ML in the design of new molecules employing phenotypic and high-content screening data and assessing their potency, selectivity, and binding affinity</li><li>Use of ML models for predicting bioactivity and ADMET parameters of compounds</li></ul></li><li>Ligand discovery for therapeutics development or as clinical research tools (e.g., imaging probes) for novel molecular targets implicated in mental illnesses.</li><li>Biotechnology products and biologics including, but not limited to, large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides), gene-based therapies (i.e., oligonucleotide- and viral-based), cell therapies, and novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies).</li><li>The inclusion of measures to assess the functional pharmacological activity of the agent is encouraged in dose-finding studies.</li><li>Phase Ib studies in the proposed disease population to confirm target engagement, establish optimal dosing, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), CNS exposure, functional pharmacological or neurophysiological activity, and tolerability of the novel agent, compound, or device.</li><li>Novel tool and biomarker development to enable studies to assess target engagement, brain PD, and PK for innovative drug targets; for example, PET or SPECT tracers for evaluating receptor occupancy and interrogating dose-response relationships.</li><li>Phase I studies (FIH pharmacology experiments) that include (PD/PK biomarkers to assess target engagement, functional pharmacological activity or neurophysiological effect, safety, and tolerability of new drugs.</li><li>Initial Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology, safety pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin human clinical testing.</li><li>Development and application of novel assays for evaluating brain PD/PK relationships in preclinical and early-phase human studies.</li></ul><p>NIMH also encourages applications ranging from early-stage, pre-clinical, device development to FIH clinical trials. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Regulatory activities, including pre-submission meetings with FDA, Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) submission, risk determinations, or other FDA regulatory submissions.</li><li>Modeling technologies capable of precisely characterizing delivered dose of neuromodulation technologies (e.g., electric field modeling) and to accurately measure the impact of the delivered dosage on neural functioning (e.g., simultaneous TMS-EEG, TMS-fMRI or other technologies to demonstrate engagement of the targeted distributed network or neural oscillatory target).</li><li>Linkage of behavior with brain recordings via high-density recordings of both.</li><li>FIH, proof of concept studies that may assess initial measures of safety and efficacy and lead to further refinement of the device.</li><li>Development of packaging, connectors, and other accessories necessary for the translation of this technology.</li><li>Activities to bring the development process under Design and Quality Systems Control.</li><li>Activities to become current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant.</li><li>GLP compliant large animal model safety and/or testing of an implanted device.</li><li>Bench-top and/or animal testing to demonstrate compliance with FDA Recognized Standards.</li><li>Non-GLP animal studies to develop techniques relevant to the device, optimize relevant therapeutic parameters, and refine device design as necessary for subsequent GLP testing or additional clinical studies for regulatory approval.</li><li>Device, software, and firmware design verification and validation activities.</li></ul><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>In summary, the NCDDG Program will support broad, innovative, multidisciplinary approaches to the discovery of new, rationally based treatments and research tools for mental disorders. Since the creative talents in the required scientific disciplines are rarely available in a single institution, a multi-institutional, group approach involving academic, nonprofit, commercial, and/or industrial institutions is envisioned. Academic, pharmaceutical, and biomedical technology scientists are strongly encouraged to form partnerships that take full advantage of their combined intellectual and material resources for drug discovery, lead optimization, model development, and clinical testing. Further, the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with the pharmaceutical and biomedical device industry and NIH is expected to facilitate subsequent development and marketing of new pharmacologic and device treatments, although these latter activities are not within the scope of this NOFO. Molecular targets for drug/device discovery, and the sources and types of chemical/circuit entities to be investigated will be selected by the applying group. Both novel mechanisms of action and disease-oriented approaches are of interest.</p><p><strong>Research Scope</strong></p><p>The objective of this NOFO is to establish NCDDG Groups to conduct innovative, high-impact research focused on the discovery and testing of small molecules or biotechnology products and biologics with potential as candidate therapeutics including, but not limited to, large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides), gene-based therapies (i.e., oligonucleotide- and viral vector-based), cell therapies, and novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies) &nbsp;for novel molecular targets, as well as novel devices for novel circuit/neural dynamic targets implicated in the pathophysiology of mental disorders. The NCDDG serves as a vehicle for pharmaceutical, biomedical devices, and academic scientists to pool intellectual and material resources for the translation of basic science findings into the conceptualization, discovery, and evaluation of new chemical entities and devices. Groups are encouraged to select molecular targets for drug discovery and circuit targets for device discovery based on recent findings in basic and clinical neuroscience, genetics, and proteomics relevant to the understanding of mental disorders.</p><p>The identification of lead compounds/candidate agents/devices and refining them for target validation and medication development are important goals of this initiative.</p><p>It is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with NIH and pharmaceutical industry will facilitate timely evaluation and development of preclinical and clinical research tools, models, and novel therapeutics.</p><p>Applicants seeking additional sources of support for preclinical development activities such as toxicology and safety pharmacology assessment, bulk synthesis, GMP synthesis, and formulation development should consider the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network program (<a href="http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/index.htm">http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/index.htm</a> or <a href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics"><u>https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics</u></a>) and/or the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/bridgs/about">NIH Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) Program</a>.</p><p>Prior to submission of an application, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant Scientific/Research Contact listed in Section VII of this NOFO to determine if the proposed Research Project would be considered a priority for NIMH.</p><p>Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should consider provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly.</p><p>The NIMH has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-19-027.html">NOT-MH-19-027</a>). The application&#146;s PHS Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information, including the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. Plans for the protection of research participants and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the NIMH for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations.</p>

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply- Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>

All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Management and Sharing Plan.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;">To advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded by NIMH under this NOFO are expected to share those data via the&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive</a>&nbsp;(NDA; see&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-23-100.html">NOT-MH-23-100</a>). Established by the NIH, NDA is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. NDA links data across research projects through its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) and Data Dictionary technology. Investigators funded under this NOFO are expected to use these technologies to submit data to NDA.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">To accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a GUID for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. The <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">NDA</a> website provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1)&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/contribute_cost_estimation.html">t</a><a href="https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/contribute-data.html#cost">he NDA Data Submission Cost Model&nbsp;</a>which offers a customizable Excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the Program Director/Principal Investigator and Data Manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the NDA's&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/contribute-data.html">Data Contribution page</a>. Investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this NOFO prior to submission to NDA and review their data for accuracy after submission. Submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every January 15 and July 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/nda/sharing-regimen">NDA Sharing Regimen</a>&nbsp;for more information); Investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied.For more guidance on submitting data to NDA, refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">NDA Data Management and Sharing Plan on the NDA website</a>. NDA staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/data_dictionary.html">NDA Data Dictionary</a>.&nbsp;</p>

CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a &#147;Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal" (<a href="http://cde.nih.gov/">http://cde.nih.gov/</a>) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">NIMH expects investigators for this funding announcement to collect Common Data Elements (CDEs) for mental health human subjects research. Unless NIMH stipulates otherwise during the negotiation of the terms and conditions of a grant award, this Notice applies to all grant applications involving human research participants. The necessary funds for collecting and submitting these CDE data from all research participants to the&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">NIMH Data Archive (NDA)</a>&nbsp;should be included in the requested budget. A cost estimator (<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/Documents/NDA_Data_Submission_Costs.xlsx">https://nda.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/Documents/NDA_Data_Submission_Costs.xlsx</a>) is available to facilitate the calculation of these costs.

By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain &#147;applicable clinical trials&#148; on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (<a href="https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/">https://register.clinicaltrials.gov</a>). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm</a></p>

<p>Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.</p>

<p>Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at <a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm</a> and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).</p>

<p>Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).</p>

Publication or oral presentation of work done under this agreement will be accompanied by an appropriate acknowledgment of NIMH support, including the assigned cooperative agreement award number.</li><li>Share data and resources generated under this project with the scientific community, as permitted by law, in a timely manner and as directed under the applicable NIMH and NIH policies sharing policies.</li><li>PD(s)/PI(s) agree to participate in the cooperative research program, including serving on the Steering Committee, participating in Steering Committee in person and virtual meetings, adhering to Steering Committee policies and decisions, and accepting the participation and assistance of NIMH staff in accordance with the guidelines described under&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-12-110.html#_Cooperative_Agreement_Terms">Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award: NIH Responsibilities.</a></li><li>Recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current HHS, PHS, and NIH policies.</li><li>Participate as a voting member of the Steering Committee &nbsp;In the case of MPI award, the PIs will have one combined vote</li></ul><p><strong>NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement&nbsp;that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:</strong></p><p>The role of the NIMH Project Scientist will be to facilitate and not to direct the activities. It is anticipated that the NIMH Project Scientist will offer advisory input. The NIMH Project Scientist will:</p><ul><li>Provide guidance and support in the design of research activities.</li><li>Serve as a resource for protocol design and development.</li><li>Advise in the selection of sources or drug development resources&nbsp;(e.g., CNS receptor screening, NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics chemical synthesis or toxicology services).</li><li>Advise in management and technical performance.</li><li>Participate as a voting member in the Steering Committee (SC). Regardless of the number of Project Scientists, NIH has only one vote.</li></ul><p>Additionally, an agency program official or IC program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.</p><p>The NIMH Program Official will:</p><ul><li>Provide the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award, including programmatic monitoring of the overall project.</li><li>Prior to award, negotiate the final Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMS Plan) and research resource sharing plan and the milestones to ensure that the goals of the project are being met.</li><li>Monitor Milestones and data sharing.</li><li>Approve modifications to the research plan and/or study protocol(s), in consultation with the SC, based on emerging data and/or other issues that impact progress of the project.</li><li>Reserve the right to obtain periodic external peer review and recommend reviewers for an assessment of progress and achievement of milestones and deliverables.</li><li>May attend SC meetings as a non-voting observer.</li></ul><p><strong>Areas of Joint Responsibility</strong></p><ul><li><u>Steering Committee</u>: A governing Steering Committee composed of the PD/PI(s), key research scientists, collaborators or consultants, outside experts, the NIH Project Scientist(s) will be established in each NCDDG to assist in monitoring and developing the scientific content and direction of the program. When included in the Steering Committee, outside experts are chosen by the PD/PI(s) in consultation with the NIH Project Scientist and Program Official. Each named member of the Steering Committee will have one vote, In the case of MPI award, the PIs will have one combined vote.</li><li>Coordination and facilitation of interactions among the recipients under this initiative.</li><li>Facilitation of collaboration with other NIMH-supported research resources.</li><li>Assist in avoiding unwarranted duplication of effort with other NIH efforts.</li><li>Schedule and organize <u>in-person and virtual meetings</u>&nbsp;for dissemination of ideas and encouragement of scientific collaboration. The frequency of these meetings (annual, semi-annual, etc.) will be determined by the Steering Committee, which will be responsible for scheduling the time and place and for preparing concise proceedings or minutes (action items and one-two page summary) which will be delivered to the members of the Committee within 2 weeks of the meeting.</li></ul><p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p><p>Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D, and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.</p>
