# 3 Lessons Learned

1. Effective evaluation requires the use of several different metrics carefully aligned with your application's objectives.
2. Evaluation is not a one-size-fits-all process.
3. Comprehensive, representative, and diverse test data enhance the evaluation process. 

# 3 Lessons Not Learned

1. How to apply these evaluation strategies in a production system (creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement)
2. How do you know when to stop iterating? When is enough enough?
3. How to apply these evaluation approaches to multi-agent systems
