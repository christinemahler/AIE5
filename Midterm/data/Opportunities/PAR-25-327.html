			 <a id='_bookmark220632' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>This Notice Of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is part of the <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Translational-Research/urgent-network">NINDS Ultra-Rare Gene-based Therapy (URGenT)</a> network. The mission of URGenT is to support and facilitate the development of gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic agents with compelling proof-of-concept (POC) data towards First-in-Human (FIH) clinical trials for individuals suffering from severely debilitating or life-threatening ultra-rare neurological diseases. Specifically, this NOFO will support projects ready to complete Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies and initiate clinical trial planning activities. Successful projects ending with an IND cleared by FDA will be eligible to apply for funding to conduct a FIH clinical trial supported by URGenT network resources.</p><p>Applicants must have identified and characterized a clinical therapeutic candidate as supported by robust POC data for the intended therapeutic approach and specific disease. The objective of this program is to support activities, such as&nbsp;process development and cGMP manufacturing, bioassay development,&nbsp;IND-enabling safety/toxicology and biodistribution studies, and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (PK/PD) studies, to support the development of a clinical protocol, clinical end-point assay development, assembly of a research IND application, and clinical trial planning and preparedness activities. This is a milestone-driven cooperative agreement program involving participation of NIH program staff and external subject matter experts (SMEs) in the development of the project plan and monitoring of research progress.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>In the United States, a rare disease is defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, based on the definition created by Congress in the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 and adopted by the FDA. Ultra-rare diseases affect substantially fewer people, less than or equal to 6,000; in the U.S., this equates to as few or fewer than one in 50,000 people. Approximately 95% of rare diseases, including ultra-rare diseases, have no FDA-approved therapeutic available and an estimated 80% of rare diseases have an identified genetic origin. These rare diseases are often due to pathogenic variants in a single gene that alter gene product function. Many rare and ultra-rare diseases are caused by different pathogenic variants, some of which may be unique to a single individual or to a very small number of individuals. Cumulatively, these diseases represent a large unmet medical need as there are few available effective treatments and limited commercial incentive for therapeutic development.</p><p>The NINDS <u>U</u>ltra-<u>R</u>are <u>Gen</u>e-based <u>T</u>herapy (URGenT) network addresses challenges within ultra-rare disease communities by facilitating and supporting the development of tailored therapeutic interventions using established precision medicine platforms for the treatment of individuals diagnosed with a debilitating and often fatal, ultra-rare neurological and/or neuromuscular disease. Due to the urgency of these individuals&#146; conditions, rapid intervention in the clinical course of disease is critical. Therefore, the selection of a viable therapeutic approach will require the ability to customize the design, testing, and delivery of these interventions.</p><p>URGenT is poised to leverage nonclinical and manufacturing data from one project to another to enable the continuous reassessment of best development practices and clinical outcomes data. This would make a platform approach to therapeutic development more accessible to ultra-rare disease communities and applicable to a broader range of diseases. In addition, this approach aims to facilitate regulatory harmonization when possible and bring therapeutic interventions to individuals sooner.</p><p>The design of early-phase clinical trials for gene-based or transcript-directed therapies for ultra-rare patient populations often differs from the design of clinical trials for other types of therapies and relies upon unique collaborations to be successful. Successful completion of the funded project is expected to lead into a clinical trial, which will be supported by mechanisms targeted to URGenT U01 award recipients through limited competition.</p><p><strong>Research Scope</strong></p><p>URGenT provides multiple pathways into the network for studies that propose to utilize URGenT infrastructure and resources, culminating in submission of an IND package to the FDA and preparation for a subsequent application to conduct a FIH clinical trial. One path allows direct access to resources, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/PA-files/PAR-25-326.html"><u>PAR-25-326 Ultra-Rare Gene-based Therapy (URGenT) Network Resource Access (Clinical Trial Not Allowed)(X01)</u></a>, for applicants proposing to conduct planning activities and/or limited nonclinical development studies with a clinical candidate therapeutic to generate additional data (as needed) before a pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting or submission of an IND application. Another path into the network is described in this NOFO and seeks applications proposing to conduct formal IND-enabling activities and clinical trial planning activities. This program will support nonclinical IND-enabling development activities, such as cGMP manufacturing and safety/toxicology studies, of a clinical therapeutic that will lead to the assembly and submission of a research IND application. Proposals may also include support for the initiation of clinical trial planning activities.</p><p>PD(s)/PI(s) who&nbsp;have obtained a cleared IND application through the URGenT network, will also have the opportunity to submit applications for conducting a Clinical Trial through the Other Transaction funding mechanism (OTA-24-011 and OTA-24-012). Funded clinical trials could be conducted within the Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT). Investigators who already have a cleared IND may apply directly to OTA-24-011.</p><p>Since a single ultra-rare disease may be caused by many different pathogenic variants, some of which may be unique to a very small numbers of patients, the selection of a viable therapeutic approach will require the ability to customize the design, testing, and delivery of these interventions. The following gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic modalities are potentially amenable to the development of precision therapeutic approaches:</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Oligonucleotide-based approaches</u></p><p style="margin-left:50px;">Oligonucleotides offer the potential to treat many genetic diseases by either ameliorating splicing pathogenic variants, promoting exon skipping, or targeting dominantly acting transcripts. Oligonucleotide-based interventions for neurological diseases include but are not limited to antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNA) or short hairpin RNAs (shRNA).</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Viral vector-based approaches</u></p><p style="margin-left:50px;">Viral-based therapeutics (e.g., Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVs)) and other potential vector and/or delivery vehicles, containing the correct gene construct, may be used as an <i>in vivo</i> therapeutic approach to replace or knockdown expression of a disease-causing gene.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Cell therapy-based approaches</u></p><p style="margin-left:50px;">Gene-modified cell-based therapies may be used for an ex-vivo therapeutic approach. Only gene targeting cell therapies will be considered for this program.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Genome editing-based approaches</u></p><p style="margin-left:50px;">Several platform technologies such as Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), Transcription Activator-like Effector-based Nucleases (TALENs) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein systems have emerged as promising approaches to correct disease-causing pathogenic variants.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;"><u>Other gene-based therapeutic approaches</u></p><p style="margin-left:50px;">Small-molecule drugs that can selectively bind RNA and modulate pre-mRNA splicing have potential as a treatment strategy for human genetic diseases. Therefore, these nucleic acid targeted small molecules have therapeutic potential in the treatment of some ultra-rare neurological and neuromuscular diseases.</p><p><strong>Structure</strong></p><p>Applications submitted in response to this NOFO will utilize a milestone-driven cooperative agreement (U01) mechanism to conduct nonclinical IND-enabling studies, file a research IND, and prepare for a clinical trial. Applications are expected to address objectives for both the nonclinical and clinical trial preparedness milestones and are strongly encouraged to use project management principles as appropriate.</p><p>The nonclinical and clinical trial planning milestones combined are generally expected to be completed in not more than 3 years.</p><p>For each project provided access to the network, the NINDS will assemble a customized Multi-disciplinary Project Team (MPT). The MPT will include NINDS Program Staff plus members of the Program Director/Principal Investigator&#146;s (PD/PI) team and additional SME consultants. The MPT will establish an overall strategy for the project with milestones, including a plan and timeline, and will develop and coordinate activities across different URGenT contract resources.</p><p><strong>Leveraging NINDS Contract Research Resources</strong></p><p>URGenT will provide successful applicants with access to therapeutic development resources and SME consultants. These NINDS contract resources will assist investigators to rapidly advance patient-customized therapeutics through manufacturing, nonclinical toxicology testing, and evaluation in clinical studies. A list of current URGenT resources can be found at &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Translational-Research/urgent-network">http://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Translational-Research/urgent-network</a>.</p><p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p><p>Applicants that have rational POC data obtained through scientifically rigorous experimentation for a viable gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic clinical candidate for a specified ultra-rare disease patient population that supports nonclinical and clinical development are encouraged to apply.</p><ul><li>A patient or patient population has been identified with an ultra-rare neurological or neuromuscular syndrome due to a defined pathogenic variant.</li><li>A sufficient understanding of the pathogenic variant exists and is the basis of the proposed therapeutic approach that will allow for a plausible intervention strategy in the specified patient population.</li><li>The POC data demonstrated scientific rigor and established the feasibility and rationale for the use of the gene-based therapeutic candidate, as evidenced by an effective dose range using appropriate assays.</li><li>The PD/PI has identified a gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic clinical candidate supported by a substantial body of <i>in vivo&nbsp;</i>and/or <i>in vitro&nbsp;</i>data demonstrating that testing of the efficacy and preliminary safety of the candidate therapeutic in one or more model systems can mimic the planned clinical trial scenario.</li><li>The PD/PI has scheduled a Pre-IND meeting or has held formal pre-IND discussions with the relevant FDA division regarding a future regulatory path and other requirements needed by the submission date of the application.</li><li>The PD/PI is able to provide an outline of the future clinical trial, detailing aspects such as the proposed study design, study duration, study population, primary outcomes and safety measures, and data analysis methods.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>This NOFO encourages applications proposing plans for nonclinical development in parallel with clinical trial planning activities, including, but not limited to:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Manufacturing (i.e., technology transfer, process development, analytical methods development, small-scale, engineering runs, and clinical scale cGMP manufacturing of the biological therapeutic at a CMO to be used for IND-enabling studies and FIH clinical trial).</li><li>Qualification and/or validation of any bioassays required for IND-enabling nonclinical and clinical studies.</li><li>Non-clinical and non-interventional clinical studies and to support, for example, drug efficacy biomarker qualification and/or validation.</li><li>IND-enabling efficacy studies with intended clinical product.</li><li>IND-enabling biodistribution, safety, and toxicology testing in relevant animal model(s) for proposed indication in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).</li><li>Assessment of off-target effects as appropriate for the type of intervention under development</li><li>Evaluation utility of efficacy biomarkers associated with the therapeutic target or disease.</li><li>Completion of all clinical trial planning activities necessary for implementation of future clinical trial, including but not limited to IRB approval.</li><li>Preparation and submission of an IND package to FDA.</li></ul><p><strong>Milestones</strong></p><p>Because therapeutics development is inherently high risk, it is expected that there may be attrition as projects progress. Clear Go/No-Go milestones will be established by the MPT. The MPT will establish an overall strategy for the project with milestones, including a plan and timeline, to develop and coordinate activities across different URGenT contract resources.</p><p>These milestones will be based upon a template outline of achievements necessary to progress through therapeutic development but will be tailored to the specific therapeutic and its intended disease indication. Successful continuation of projects will be contingent upon:</p><ul><li>Successful achievement of the milestones</li><li>Overall feasibility of project advancement, considering data that may not have been captured in the milestones</li><li>Additional resources needed</li><li>Ethical considerations</li></ul><p><strong>Clinical Trial Information</strong></p><p><strong>For applications proposing a clinical trial, note the following definitions and restrictions for this funding announcement:</strong></p><ul><li>NIH defines clinical trials are research studies in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes. For this funding announcement, <strong>only the following types of clinical trials will be supported:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/glossary-ct.htm#MechanisticStudy"><strong>Mechanistic trials</strong></a><strong>, </strong>defined as studies designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention (i.e., HOW an intervention works, but not IF it works or is safe).</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Clinical trials that seek to answer specific questions about safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of pharmacologic, behavioral, biologic, surgical, or device (invasive or non-invasive) interventions, preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions <strong>will not be&nbsp;</strong>supported under this Translational Efforts to Advance Gene-based Therapies for Ultra-Rare Neurological and Neuromuscular Disorders (U01) NOFO. Safety and efficacy trials as part of the URGenT network could be supported through a separate funding mechanism including but not limited to&nbsp;the NeuroNEXT network. Please refer to the Ultra-rare Gene-based Therapy (URGenT) Clinical Trials Conducted within NeuroNEXT Research Opportunity Announcement (ROA) OTA-24-011 and OTA-24-012. &nbsp;</li><li>For further clarification on how NIH defines the different types of clinical trials, please refer to the following resources:<ul><li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html">NOT-OD-15-015: Notice of Revised NIH Definition of &#147;Clinical Trial&#148;</a></li><li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/definition.htm">NIH's Definition of a Clinical Trial</a></li><li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/ct-decision/index.htm">Decision Tree for NIH Clinical Trial Definition</a><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/case-studies.htm">NIH Definition of Clinical Trial Case Studies</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>Applicants are strongly advised to consult with NINDS Scientific/Research staff prior to submitting an application with human subjects to determine the appropriate funding opportunity.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO:</strong></p><p>Nonresponsive applications include those that involve any of the following activities:</p><ul><li>Ultra-rare diseases studies for diseases or disorders outside the mission of NINDS</li><li>Screening to identify and/or optimize lead therapeutic agents</li><li>Nonclinical studies of disease mechanism or therapeutic mechanism of action studies</li><li>Animal model development</li><li>Development of diagnostics or diagnostic devices</li><li>Research focused entirely on biomarkers and/or clinical endpoint development</li><li>Early-stage projects without significant POC data that have not identified a lead clinical candidate ready for IND-directed development</li><li>Clinical trials that seek to answer specific questions about safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of pharmacologic, behavioral, biologic, surgical, or device (invasive or non-invasive) interventions, preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions</li></ul><p><i><u>Nonresponsive applications will be administratively withdrawn prior to review.</u></i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property Rights and Confidentiality</strong></p><p>This program is structured so that the recipient institution retains their assignment of intellectual property (IP) rights and gains assignment of IP rights from the URGenT contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for candidate therapeutics developed in this network. It is expected that the recipient institution will take responsibility for patent filings and maintenance and licensing efforts toward eventual commercialization. The PD/PI is expected to work closely with technology transfer/business development officials at his or her institution to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. Award recipients will be encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the drug development process, consistent with the goals of URGenT.</p><p>All SMEs will treat information as confidential and not disclose data or their assessments to third parties.</p><p><strong>Consultation</strong></p><p>Applicants to this NOFO are strongly encouraged to consult with the Scientific/Research staff for the area of science for which they are planning to develop an application. Early contact, at least six (6) weeks prior to the next application receipt date is strongly encouraged as it provides an opportunity for NINDS staff to discuss the scope, goals, and resources needed of the project and to provide guidance to applicants.</p>

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply-Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of&nbsp; a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>.</p>

The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code.

			 <a id='_bookmark220752' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.</p>

<p>ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain &#147;applicable clinical trials&#148; on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (<a href="https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/">https://register.clinicaltrials.gov</a>). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm</a></p>

<p>Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.</p>

<p>Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).</p>

<p>Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).</p>

			 <p>The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant administration regulations at 2 CFR Part 200, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, and "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below.</p><ul><li>The PD/PI in collaboration with the MPT will have the primary responsibility to define research objectives and approaches and to plan, conduct, analyze and publish results, interpretations and conclusions of their studies, and for providing overall scientific and administrative leadership for the research project.</li><li>The PD/PI in collaboration with the MPT will oversee all aspects of the organization and execution of the studies outlined in the application and approved by NINDS.</li><li>Recipients have primary and lead responsibilities for the project as a whole, including any modification of study design, the conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, and collaboration with other investigators unless otherwise provided for in these terms or by the action of the primary leadership committee.</li><li>Recipients will be responsible for putting all study materials and procedure manuals into the public domain. Recipients are expected to publish and publicly disseminate results, data, and other products of the study, concordant with governance policies and protocols. Publications and oral presentations of work performed under this agreement will require appropriate acknowledgment of support by the NINDS/NIH.</li><li>Recipients will be responsible for obtaining prior written approval of the NINDS Grants Management Specialist in consultation with the NINDS Program Officer for any change in any of the key personnel identified in the Notice of Grant Award.</li><li>Recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current HHS, PHS, and NIH policies.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>NIH staff has substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The Project Coordinator will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the typical stewardship role in other awards, as described below. The Project Coordinator, with no role in stewardship of the award, will provide technical assistance, advice, coordination, and other program actions to support the recipients of the cooperative agreement during the conduct of an activity. In addition to the Project Coordinator, an NINDS Administrative Program Officer (PO) will be responsible for normal program stewardship of awards and will sign off on the grant documents and be responsible for the stewardship of the award, including monitoring implementation of the Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMS Plan) and Research Resource Sharing Plan. The PO is named in the award notice.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Joint Responsibilities</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The MPT will include NINDS Program Staff plus members of the Program Director/Principal Investigator&#146;s (PD/PI) team and additional SME consultants. The MPT will establish an overall strategy for the project with milestones, including a plan and timeline, and will develop and coordinate activities across different URGenT contract resources.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The MPT will:</p><ul><li>Have access to data generated under this Cooperative Agreement and may periodically review the data and administrative progress reports. Program staff may use information obtained from the data for the preparation of internal reports on the activities of the study. However, recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to all data developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with HHS, PHS, and NIH policies.</li><li>Serve as a resource to provide scientific/programmatic support during the accomplishment of the research by participating in the design of the activities, advising in the selection of sources or resources (e.g., determining where a particular reagent can be found), provision of research resources and reagents available from NINDS recipients and contractors, advising in management and technical performance, or participating in the preparation of publications.</li><li>Monitor progress of study milestones; as with any award, continuation, even during the period recommended for support, is contingent upon satisfactory progress. Progress will be monitored by NINDS. The schedule for these interim reviews will be based upon the duration of the clinical trial period. Continuation of funding will be dependent upon the recipient&#146;s ability to show adequate progress towards milestone accomplishment.</li></ul><p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p><p>Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.</p>
