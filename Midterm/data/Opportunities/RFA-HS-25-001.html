			 <a id='_bookmark214219' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><h4>Purpose</h4><p>The goal of this NOFO is to disseminate and implement patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) evidence for Long COVID care into practice through up-to-date clinical decision support (CDS). Because Long COVID is a clinical area where research evidence is rapidly evolving, funded applications will demonstrate how healthcare organizations can consistently update their clinical decision support (CDS) systems for Long COVID care to reflect emerging evidence. It is&nbsp;envisioned that research results will help other healthcare systems design similar processes for Long COVID and other post-infectious illnesses where the evidence and treatment are rapidly evolving.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>AHRQ has a rich history of investing in CDS to bridge the gap between research findings and their application in clinical settings. With the reauthorization of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCOR TF) in 2019, AHRQ has continued to fund its&nbsp;<a href="https://cds.ahrq.gov/">multi-component initiative</a> aimed at advancing PCOR evidence into practice through CDS and to make CDS more shareable, interoperable, and publicly available. CDS can take many forms, such as order sets, recommendations about needed care like screening tests, dashboards that can provide summary information, and alerts that need attention from care team members. CDS is developed to implement current medical knowledge and clinical practice guidelines to provide the right information, to the right people, in the right formats, through the right channels, at the right times, in the clinical workflow.<sup>1</sup> Various sources, such as clinical practice guidelines, peer-reviewed literature, and local best practices, form the basis for these CDS tools, which provide a means to advance new medical knowledge into clinical practice more quickly and effectively. Therefore, the ability to quickly update these CDS tools is an important component of providing new knowledge to clinical providers, especially when that knowledge is rapidly updated.</p><p>Other initiatives in the public and private sectors with similar goals have also gained momentum. For example, efforts such as Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has sponsored several projects to advance the computability of clinical practice guidelines and the interoperability of CDS, such as through its work with Health Level 7 (HL7). In 2017, the National Academy of Medicine introduced thirteen key priorities in their publication "Optimizing Strategies for Clinical Decision Support". One of these priorities was the establishment of an investment program for CDS research.</p><p>One area that requires further exploration is how healthcare systems can transform the latest research findings into new or updated CDS more efficiently. Developing, maintaining, and updating CDS often depends on lengthy and labor-intensive processes, which can be particularly problematic in clinical domains where evidence and best practices are evolving quickly. Many facets may impact CDS implementation including obtaining the necessary approvals, governance requirements, authoring the updates to the CDS, clinical considerations and review, and technical considerations, as well as the necessary resources to deploy and test the update.</p><p>Each of these areas may have their own sub-processes to implement updates to the CDS based on new evidence. For example, (1) clinical committees may need to review and approve new clinical practice pathways, (2) administrative or departmental leadership may need to approve funding or address staff changes related to clinical workflows, and (3) Information Technology leadership and staff will need to review changes and dedicate resources to test and deploy the CDS implementation. Each of these processes may occur in different departments within the healthcare organization, which necessitates additional processes for communicating and monitoring approvals and implementation as a whole.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the necessity for streamlined administrative and knowledge management practices. Once an organization has made the determination that evidence has changed and their organization&#146;s practices need to be updated accordingly, updated CDS tools with the latest evidence for improved patient care is important to ensuring that the best evidence can get to practice effectively. This need has evolved to include diagnosing and managing Long COVID, as research into the biology and treatment of post-infectious conditions produces new evidence. The complex, multi-system nature of Long COVID, relative lack of evidence for diagnosis and treatment, and the massive federal investment in new research make it an ideal context for developing more advanced, timely CDS that can quickly incorporate new evidence to inform care decisions.<sup>2</sup></p><p>With complicated treatment approaches like Long COVID, a more comprehensive understanding of the framework supporting CDS infrastructure that can deliver updated best practices &ndash; which can include local platforms and protocols --is crucial to fostering agility in these systems and ensuring swift updates aligned with emerging evidence. The concept of updating CDS to incorporate the latest knowledge aligns closely with frameworks that describe learning health systems. When health evidence is rapidly changing, the ongoing evaluation of CDS performance is essential. Using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/learning-health-systems/resources.html">learning health system</a> framework would employ internal data and experience that is then systematically integrated with external evidence, analyzed for impact, and then iteratively improved. Applicants may use this framework, or a similar framework, which could provide a broad, systems view for their evaluation and that reflects a culture of adaptation.</p><p>Additionally, the AHRQ-developed Analytic Framework for Action (AFA),<sup>3</sup> is based on early understanding of learning health systems and provides a useful framework for understanding and organizing the cyclic nature of providing maintenance and updates required for keeping CDS up to date. The AFA cycle involves prioritizing what evidence-based practice should be considered, updating the CDS tools, testing and deploying the updated CDS, and validating CDS performance and impact. Other considerations, such as governance, marketplace, and legal factors can influence any or all the phases. This framework includes a focus on what is important to patients and families throughout the cycle and has been advanced further by ongoing work in the&nbsp;<a href="https://cdsic.ahrq.gov/">CDS Innovation Collaborative.</a></p><p>The process to support and sustain CDS can be complex, requiring the implementation of new versions of the software to stay current with practice guidelines. The symptoms and recommended practice standards related to Long COVID are revised often and not on a predictable schedule, which requires multiple CDS updates. Therefore, combining the emerging work on Long COVID with improving the processes to update production CDS systems will provide multiple opportunities to apply these lessons learned across the healthcare system.</p><p>For CDS to improve care it needs to support person-centered care for people living with Long COVID who often have multisystem involvement and multiple underlying chronic conditions. Providing care requires considering the impact of evidence-based recommendations on the overall care of the patient. Therefore, the CDS should support person-centered, whole person care.</p><h4><strong>Objectives and Scope</strong></h4><p>The objective of this NOFO is to disseminate and implement patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) evidence for Long COVID care into practice through up-to-date clinical decision support (CDS). More investigation is required to learn how healthcare systems can update and maintain CDS in rapidly changing clinical domains. Funded applications will demonstrate how healthcare systems can update and maintain their CDS systems to reflect the latest evidence-based care for Long COVID.</p><p>To meet this objective, proposals must:</p><ul><li>Describe the evidence for Long COVID care that forms the basis for their CDS and the plan(s) for identifying new evidence to be incorporated into the CDS.</li><li>Describe the processes for how the CDS will be updated as new evidence is identified and how those processes &ndash; technical, clinical, and administrative &ndash; will be studied.</li><li>Describe how the proposed work will reduce implementation cycle times for updated Long COVID CDS, including a description of the process improvement framework to be used and the rationale for using the chosen framework.</li><li>Describe the relevance and use of standards, such as:<ul><li>Health Level 7 International, Clinical Practice Guideline on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (HL7 CPG-on-FHIR) standard and implementation guide (https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CDS/CPGonFHIR).</li><li>Clinical Quality Language (CQL).</li><li>Long COVID value sets,<sup>4</sup> or similar sets of codes based on standardized terminologies.</li></ul></li><li>Include a plan for evaluating and monitoring how well the updated CDS processes are valued by the intended stakeholders who would be using these CDS tools<ul><li>To support person-centered whole person care, patients should also be considered as stakeholders in this evaluation and monitoring plan</li></ul></li><li>Consider equity and bias in the development and modification of the CDS tools.</li><li>Describe how safety net providers will be included in the development process so that these tools may potentially be usable in other healthcare environments.</li><li>Describe how the project fits within one of the four main elements of the AHRQ PCORTF Strategic Framework (<a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/pcor/strategic-framework/index.html">https://www.ahrq.gov/pcor/strategic-framework/index.html)</a>, including how the research is conducted through a health equity lens.</li><li>Include a detailed project timeline that shows major milestones.</li><li>Include a plan of how the project will disseminate lessons learned and contribute to the community of CDS developers and implementers.</li></ul><h4>Examples of highly responsive topics include, but are not limited to:</h4><ul><li>Innovative use of visualization tools or dashboards to monitor the improvement cycle.</li><li>Enhancing the processes that examine how evolving evidence for Long COVID will be collected and locally validated.</li><li>Changes to the CDS software design that would allow new recommendations to the symptoms and conditions that define Long COVID to be updated using a simple approach.</li><li>Changes to the IT implementation workflow that would reduce the cycle time required to update the CDS for Long COVID.</li><li>Processes for data collection and analysis, related to change approval, resources needed, and development that would improve the quality, efficiency, and timeliness of this process.</li><li>Improving the training processes used to educate clinical staff on the use of the updated Long COVID CDS.</li></ul><h4>Definitions</h4><p>Clinical Decision Support (CDS): provides timely information to help inform decisions about patient care. CDS is patient-specific and can take many forms, such as order sets, recommendations about needed care, summary information, and alerts. CDS is a set of technology-based tools that delivers the right information to the right people using the right channels and formats at the right times.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Health information technology (health IT): technology used to acquire, analyze, or deliver information required for CDS design, deployment, and evaluation. Examples include electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchanges, clinician and patient-facing apps, dashboards, and middleware.</p><p>Implementation cycle: For updating CDS in a health system, an implementation cycle is the full cycle of multiple business functions in the organization that leads to deployment in live, operational settings. This includes, but is not limited to, identifying new clinical recommendations, request, and approval processes for developing and updating CDS, deciding upon and allocating IT resources, testing updated CDS, training of staff, and deploying the updated software. Depending on the organization, there may be other requirements for change approval for the updated CDS.</p><p>Long COVID: an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing, and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.<sup>5-7</sup></p><p>Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR): is comparative clinical effectiveness research of the impact on health outcomes of two or more preventive, diagnostic, treatment, or healthcare delivery approaches. PCOR produces not only clinical findings (e.g., thiazide diuretics are an effective first-line therapy for hypertension), but also evidence about the effectiveness of how healthcare is delivered. There are multiple sources of PCOR findings, including but not limited to those listed below:</p><p>AHRQ Effective Health Care Program (<a href="https://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/">http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/</a>)</p><p>Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (<a href="http://www.pcori.org/" Title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">http://www.pcori.org/</a>)</p><p>U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (<a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/" Title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/</a>)</p><p>Community Preventive Services Task Force (<a href="https://www.thecommunityguide.org/" Title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/</a>)</p><h4>References:</h4><p style="margin-left:.5in;">1.

There is no budget allocation guideline for determining substantial involvement; determination of substantial involvement is based on a review of the primary project activities for which grant support is provided and the organization(s) that will be performing those activities</p>

If specific expenditures would otherwise require prior approval, the recipient must obtain AHRQ approval before incurring the cost. AHRQ prior approval is required for any costs to be incurred more than 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award.</p><p>The incurrence of pre-award costs in anticipation of a competing or non-competing award imposes no obligation on AHRQ either to make the award or to increase the amount of the approved budget if an award is made for less than the amount anticipated and is inadequate to cover the pre-award costs incurred. AHRQ expects the recipient to be fully aware that pre-award costs result in borrowing against future support and that such borrowing must not impair the recipient's ability to accomplish the project objectives in the approved time frame or in any way adversely affect the conduct of the project.</p>

The overall portfolio of health services research that AHRQ conducts and supports shall include the populations specifically named in AHRQ&#146;s authorizing legislation: inner city; rural; low income; minority; women; children; elderly; and those with special health care needs, including those who have disabilities, need chronic care, or need end-of-life health care. 42 U.S.C. 299(c)(1).&nbsp;AHRQ also includes in its definition of priority populations those groups identified in Section 2(a) of Executive Order 13985 as members of underserved communities: Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.</p><p>AHRQ will broadly implement this inclusion policy across the research that AHRQ supports and conducts so that the portfolio of research is inclusive of all populations. AHRQ intends that these populations be included in studies such that the research design explicitly allows conduct of valid analyses. The policy applies to all grant applications. Investigators should review the document entitled, &#147;AHRQ Policy on the Inclusion of Priority Populations,&#148; which is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-21-015.html">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-21-015.html</a>. Applicants under this NOFO must consider and discuss including priority populations in research design as specified in this Notice.</p><p><strong>Public Access to AHRQ-Funded Scientific Publications</strong></p><p>Investigators should review the document titled &lsquo;AHRQ Policy for Public Access to AHRQ-Funded Scientific Publications&#146;, which is available at (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-25-011.html">NOT-HS-25-011: AHRQ Policy for Public Access to AHRQ-Funded Scientific Publications</a>).&nbsp;For all research arising from AHRQ support, this policy requires that AHRQ-funded authors submit an electronic version of the author&#146;s final peer-reviewed accepted manuscript to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central (PMC) to be made publicly available within 12 months of the publisher&#146;s date of publication.</p><p><strong>AHRQ Data Management Plan Policy</strong></p><p>Investigators should review the document titled AHRQ Data Management and Sharing Policy, which is available at (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-25-010.html">NOT-HS-25-010: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Data Management and Sharing Policy</a>). This policy requires applicants for AHRQ new/competing grants and research contracts to include a DMP for managing, storing and disseminating the primary data, samples, physical collections, and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of research funded by AHRQ, or state why data management is not possible, as a component of their grant application or research contract proposal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Plan for Sharing Research Data</strong></p><p>The precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. Applicants who are planning to share data should describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing; the format of the final dataset; the documentation to be provided; whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided; whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use); and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under its own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on its institutional or personal website or through a data archive or enclave). Investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement. References to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application.</p><p>The reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data will be assessed by the reviewers. However, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score.</p><p><strong>Data Confidentiality</strong></p><p>The AHRQ confidentiality statute, 42 USC 299c-3(c), requires that information that is obtained in the course of AHRQ supported activities and that identifies individuals or establishments be used only for the purpose for which it was supplied.&nbsp;Information that is obtained in the course of AHRQ-supported activities and that identifies an individual may be published or released only with the consent of the individual who supplied the information or is described in it. There are civil monetary penalties for violation of the confidentiality provision of the AHRQ statute. 42 USC 299c-3(d).&nbsp;In the Human Subjects section of the application, applicants must describe procedures for ensuring the confidentiality of the identifying information to be collected (see&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-18-012.html">NOT-HS-18-012</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-18-012.html">Confidentiality</a> in AHRQ-Supported Research).&nbsp;The description of the procedures should include a discussion of who will be permitted access to this information, both raw data and machine-readable files, and how personal identifiers and other identifying or identifiable data will be restricted and safeguarded.&nbsp;Identifiable patient health information collected by recipient under this NOFO will also be obtained and managed in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164.</p><p>The recipient should ensure that computer systems containing confidential data have a level and scope of security that equals or exceeds that established by the HIPAA Security Rules if applicable (see HIPAA website in prior paragraph) and that established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in OMB Circular No. A-130, Appendix III - Security of Federal Automated Information Systems. The applicability and intended means of applying these confidentiality and security standards to subcontractors and vendors, if any, should be addressed in the application.</p><p><strong>Sharing Research Resources: Rights in Data</strong></p><p>Unless otherwise provided in grant awards, AHRQ recipients may copyright, or seek patents for, as appropriate, final and interim products and materials developed in whole or in part with AHRQ support, including, but not limited to, methodological tools, measures, software with documentation, literature searches, and analyses.&nbsp;Such copyrights and patents are subject to a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable AHRQ license to reproduce, publish, use, or disseminate for any purpose consistent with AHRQ&#146;s statutory responsibilities and to authorize others to do so for any purpose consistent with AHRQ&#146;s statutory responsibilities. In accordance with its legislative dissemination mandate, AHRQ purposes may include, subject to statutory confidentiality protections, making project materials, databases, results, and algorithms available for verification or replication by other researchers. In addition, subject to AHRQ budget constraints, final products may be made available to the health care community and the public by AHRQ or its agents if such distribution would significantly increase access to a product and thereby produce substantial or valuable public health benefits. Ordinarily, to accomplish distribution, AHRQ publicizes research findings but relies on recipients to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals and to market grant-supported products. AHRQ requests that recipients notify the Office of Communications (OC) when an AHRQ-funded research article has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Researchers should submit manuscripts that have been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to&nbsp;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3d7752484f535c516d485f51544e5554535a7d5c554f4c1355554e135a524b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="81cbeef4f3efe0edd1f4e3ede8f2e9e8efe6c1e0e9f3f0afe9e9f2afe6eef7">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> at least four to six weeks in advance of the journal&#146;s expected publication date.</p><p>Regulations applicable to AHRQ recipients concerning intangible rights and copyright can be found at 45 CFR 75.322.</p>

Reporting</h4><p>For details regarding annual progress report submission, refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/grant-mgmt/noncomp.html">https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/grant-mgmt/noncomp.html</a>. If instructions on the AHRQ website are different from the RPPR Instructions, follow the instructions on the AHRQ website. Annual progress reports are due 3 months before the start date of the next budget period of the award.</p><p>Recipients are required to submit expenditure data on the Federal Financial Report (FFR; SF 425) annually.</p><p>Expenditure data is to be reported on the Federal Financial Report (FFR; SF 425). AHRQ requires annual financial expenditure reports for ALL grant programs as described in the HHS Grants Policy Statement (<a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/hhspolicy/index.html">https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/hhspolicy/index.html</a>). AHRQ implementation of the FFR retains a financial reporting period that coincides with the budget period of a particular project. However, the due date for annual FFRs is 90 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the budget period ends.&nbsp;For example, if the budget period ends 4/30/2023, the annual FFR is due 9/30/2023 (90 days after the end of the calendar quarter of 6/30/2023).</p><p>A final Progress Report, final Federal Financial Report, and Final Invention Statement are required when an award ends. All final reports are due within 120 days of the project period end date. For further details regarding grant closeout requirements, refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/grant-mgmt/index.html#Closeout.">http://www.ahrq.gov/funding/grant-mgmt/index.html#Closeout.</a></p><p>The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All recipients of applicable AHRQ grants and cooperative agreements&nbsp;are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at <a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11170">www.fsrs.gov</a> on all subawards over the threshold. See the 2 CFR Part 170 (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-I/part-170">https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-I/part-170</a>) for additional information on this reporting requirement.</p><p>In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and 2 CFR Part 200.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 and 2 CFR Part 200, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM)&nbsp;about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings.&nbsp;Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 and 2 CFR Part 200 &ndash; Award Term and Condition for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.</p>
