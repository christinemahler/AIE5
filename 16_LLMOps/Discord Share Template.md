# 3 Lessons Learned

1. Caching is an effective way to reduce latency both for embeddings and prompts.
2. Agent IDEs are a new development tool coming onto the scene that appear to make developing agentic applications more streamlined.
3. Deep research applications can write a paper a lot faster than me.

# 3 Lessons Not Learned

1. How to implement caching in a production environment.
2. How to use caching with other vector stores and/or models.
3. Is it possible to create a partial caching solution? Where you only cache common embeddings/queries and purge everything else. Does this have any advantage?
