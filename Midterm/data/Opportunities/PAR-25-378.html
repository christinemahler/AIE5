		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p style="margin-left:0in;">The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support&nbsp;planning and development, including pilot or feasibility research, to improve health in Native American populations. Proposed research may address health promotion, disease prevention, treatment, recovery, or services research to inform intervention implementation and dissemination. Research with Native American populations requires engagement with tribal partners and communities to develop and/or adapt interventions and clinical trial protocols, understand intervention feasibility and acceptability, and identify and/or develop scientifically rigorous and culturally appropriate study designs and methods.&nbsp;</span>Preparatory studies may fill information gaps, address unknowns, allow for strengthening of partnerships with Native American community leaders and organizations, and pilot test the feasibility of the intervention and clinical trial design, thereby improving scientific rigor and cultural appropriateness of a future efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation trial. This NOFO is part of the&nbsp;Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) initiative, which also includes <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-379.html">PAR-25-379</a>, which uses the R01 Research Project Grant mechanism and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-380.html">PAR-25-380</a>, which uses the R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant mechanism. Research projects may address topics within the identified interests of any of the participating Institutes or Centers; projects are not limited to substance use and addiction research.</p><p>For the purposes of this NOFO, Native Americans include the following populations: Alaska Natives, American Indians (whose ancestral lands fall at least partially within the U.S. mainland border), and Native Hawaiians. The term &lsquo;Native Hawaiian&#146; means any individual any of whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area which now comprises the State of Hawaii.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220632' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><h4 style="margin-left:0in;">Purpose</h4><p style="margin-left:0in;">The purpose of this&nbsp;notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support planning and development, including pilot or feasibility research, in advance of a clinical trial testing interventions to improve health in Native American populations. Proposed research may address health promotion, disease prevention, treatment, recovery, or services research to inform intervention implementation and dissemination.  Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, recruitment challenges, intervention feasibility and acceptability, outcome measures, data and statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely.&nbsp;</span>Native American populations experience unique sociopolitical, historical, and environmental stressors and risks that may exacerbate health conditions and/or impact the effectiveness of existing solutions to address the conditions. They also possess unique strengths and resiliencies that can mitigate stressors and inform intervention strategies.  Research with Native American populations requires engagement with tribal partners and communities to develop or adapt interventions and evaluate them with clinical trial protocols that are rigorous and culturally appropriate.&nbsp;</span>Preparatory studies may fill information gaps, address unknowns, allow for strengthening of tribal partnerships, and pilot test the feasibility of the intervention and clinical trial design, thereby improving scientific rigor and cultural appropriateness of the future clinical trial. Research projects may address topics within the identified interests of any of the participating Institutes or Centers. The inclusion of Native American investigators serving on the study team or as the PD(s)/PI(s) is strongly encouraged.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">For the purposes of this NOFO, Native Americans include the following populations: Alaska Natives (AN), American Indians (AI); whose ancestral lands fall at least partially within the U.S. mainland border), and Native Hawaiians. The term &lsquo;Native Hawaiian&#146; means any individual any of whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area which now comprises the State of Hawaii.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>Despite tremendous strengths, Native Americans have highly disparate rates of disease across many health outcomes such as chronic disease, substance use and addiction, cancer, mental illness, and sexually transmitted diseases.&nbsp;These disease outcomes in many cases can be traced to socio-structural factors and social and environmental determinants of health such as poverty, unemployment, pollution, and poor access to health care in combination with unique factors impacting Native people, such as historical trauma. In the face of these structural challenges, resiliencies and strengths within Native communities and individuals have been drawn upon to improve health outcomes.</p><p>A critical step towards ensuring scalable and sustainable interventions to reduce the health disparities impacting Native American communities is the development of scientifically rigorous and culturally appropriate clinical trials to test intervention efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation. Active and meaningful engagement of tribal communities and tribal leadership is essential to successful intervention development, adaptation, testing, implementation, and dissemination and to accelerate&nbsp;the translation of findings generated by the proposed research into practice. To this end, this R34 NOFO supports&nbsp; planning studies to strengthen community and tribal partnerships, develop and adapt interventions, collect intervention feasibility and acceptability data, test recruitment and retention strategies, and/or address clinical trial study design questions. Studies under this R34 planning grant are intended to address issues that will prepare the future clinical trial protocol for successful implementation and completion and facilitate rigorous full-scale testing of promising interventions to improve Native American health. Applicants must include specific milestones and/or study targets that, if met, will indicate readiness to conduct the planned future intervention efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation trial.</span></p><p>This NOFO is part of the&nbsp;<strong>Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) initiative </strong>(see: <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/native-american-intervention">https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/native-american-intervention</a>). The initiative also includes<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-379.html"> PAR-25-379</a>, which uses the R01 Research Project Grant mechanism and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-380.html">PAR-25-380</a> which uses the R21 Exploratory/Developmental Grant mechanism. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-379.html">PAR-25-379</a> and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-380.html">PAR-25-380 </a>have broader scope than this NOFO. <u>Not all NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) participate in all three NOFOs</u>. Please speak with the Scientific Contact for the IC listed in Section VII below for the IC you wish to target to discuss which NOFO might be the best fit for your proposed project.</p><h4>Scope</h4><p style="margin-left:0in;">The activities proposed will depend on the stage of intervention development, the delivery setting, and the type of future trial proposed (e.g., efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation). Pilot tests of feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and/or future trial protocol are within scope of this NOFO.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Research should be designed in such a way that there is a high probability that interventions delivered can be scaled and sustained if the future trial finds the intervention to be effective. To ensure sustainability of intervention designs and service delivery strategies tested, applicants should, whenever possible, partner with tribes/communities and localities that use existing programming funds (e.g., funding from CDC, SAMHSA, Indian Health Services, Medicaid, Medicare and other insurance providers, and other program funding as appropriate) to support evidence-based programs and leverage those resources as the foundation for building infrastructure.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Examples of appropriate research activities include the following, but this list is not intended to be exhaustive:</p><ul><li>Activities to&nbsp;further develop and establish meaningful and trusted partnerships&nbsp;with Native communities.</li><li>Develop culturally grounded study designs in collaboration with Native American community partners to ensure acceptability and feasibility in Native communities, including developing and/or selecting an intervention, defining the appropriate study population, outcome, study endpoint, and control or comparison group to use in the subsequent efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation trial.</li><li>Determine the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention for study participants, Native American communities, and tribal partners, including standardization across sites and measures of intervention fidelity when appropriate.</li><li>Adapt, standardize, and/or validate an intervention or assessment originally designed for non-Native populations for Native populations.</li><li>Develop a novel intervention grounded in Indigenous Knowledge&nbsp;(see: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge</a>/), empirical and/or theoretical evidence, and/or adapt or standardize an intervention currently used in Native American communities to plan for a future efficacy or effectiveness trial.</li><li>Develop inclusive and culturally appropriate recruitment and retention strategies that engage Native communities.</li><li>Develop culturally informed study protocols, data and safety monitoring plans, analytical plans, and data management and sharing plans.&nbsp;</li><li>Standardize and test the effectiveness of training tools for implementation of the intervention or clinical trial protocol.</li><li>Employ qualitative methods, including talking circles, interviews, or focus groups as needed to address study aims and the development, testing and validation of quantitative survey tools. Qualitative or mixed methods research may also be helpful to assess community or tribal approval and commitment and to contextualize quantitative research findings as appropriate.</li><li>Planning activities to assess the potential feasibility and acceptability of implementation strategies to be utilized in a future implementation research trial in Native American communities, including planning for hybrid effectiveness implementation studies.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><u>This R34 NOFO will not support research testing intervention efficacy or effectiveness.</u> Efficacy or effectiveness research could be submitted to the companion IRINAH NOFOs ( <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-379.html">PAR-25-379</a> and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-380.html">PAR-25-380 </a>).</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Preliminary data are not required for this NOFO.</p><h4>Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO</h4><p>The following types of studies are not responsive to this NOFO and will not be reviewed:</p><ul><li> Applications that do not include an intervention or proposal to develop an intervention within the award period</span></li><li>Applications that propose efficacy or effectiveness testing of an intervention</li><li> Applications that only propose to write a protocol or manual</span></li><li>Applications that propose research objectives that are not aligned with the mission of any of the participating ICs</li><li>Applications that do not propose community-engaged projects</li><li>Applications that do not propose research with Native Americans</li></ul><h4> <strong>Additional Considerations for Proposed Research</strong></span></h4><p> Applicants are encouraged to consult<strong> American Indian and Alaska Native Research in the Health Sciences: Critical Considerations for the Review of Research Applications,&nbsp;</strong>which can be found at<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Critical_Considerations_for_Reviewing_AIAN_Research_508.pdf"> https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Critical_Considerations_for_Reviewing_AIAN_Research_508.pdf</span></a></p><p style="margin-left:25px;"> <strong>Coordination across projects</strong>. Although the studies supported by the IRINAH initiative will not use a common study protocol, investigators are expected to meet regularly to participate in activities in support of advancing research on Native American Health. Such activities could include participating in cross-cutting interest groups, sharing and discussion of measures, and developing collaborative publications and products. An annual meeting will be held of all investigators with optional attendance by community partners funded by the IRINAH initiative; monthly or bi-monthly phone calls will also be held. Locations of the annual meeting will vary depending on sites funded through the initiative. Project budgets should include costs for one or more study team members to attend the annual meeting.</span></p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Conceptions of Health. </strong>While the absence of a particular disease is a critical outcome, the concept of health within many Native American communities embodies wellness and is broader than the absence of disease. All four elements of life &mdash; physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual &mdash; are intricately woven together and interact to support a strong and healthy person. In this holistic perspective, illness results from imbalance and wellness from balance in these elements. For Native people who identify strongly with tribal or indigenous culture, working with traditional healers or engaging in traditional cultural practices may be a core strategy to address disease or improve wellness. For this NOFO, investigators are encouraged to consider Native concepts of health and Native traditional practices as appropriate and approved by the community.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Community Engagement.&nbsp;</strong>The appropriate conduct of research with Native American populations has been widely documented; research must be conducted in a community-engaged manner, where the community has an equal voice as a research partner. The research should be consistent with community desires and informed by these at every step of the process. Community based participatory research (CBPR) approaches are one way to ensure appropriate engagement with communities in research and the cultural appropriateness of the intervention, study design and overall approach. Where communities desire to do so, researchers should incorporate a CBPR approach. Communities may choose to pursue approaches other than CBPR, and other forms of community-engaged research are acceptable for this NOFO. The community/tribe(s) must be appropriately involved in the study design and overall approach.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Culturally Appropriate&nbsp;Research and Preparatory Activities.&nbsp;</strong>Native communities and experts on Native American research have made clear the importance of culture in addressing health outcomes. Investigators are encouraged to consider culturally unique etiological factors or targets for intervention, relying on culturally relevant theories to frame research, considering culturally specific world views and Indigenous Knowledge as they relate to the research approach and design, culturally sensitive research processes, and culturally appropriate measurement strategies and processes.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Strength-Based Focus.</strong> Since many communities place a high value on the strengths and resilience of Native peoples, investigators are encouraged to&nbsp;incorporate community/cultural strengths and resilience. It is appropriate to consider community resilience in addition to the resilience of individuals.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Interventions. </strong>Interventions must be consistent with community cultural values, and be supported by theory or empirical knowledge, which can originate from Indigenous Knowledge or from culturally appropriate non-Native paradigms. Interventions may include traditional health, medical, and/or cultural practices independent of or in concert with practices that have been tested in research with non-Native populations. Intervention delivery should, whenever possible and scientifically or otherwise appropriate, employ individuals from the community. Such interventionists could include behavioral professionals, community health workers, counselors, nutritionists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or traditional healers.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Beyond the Individual</strong> Reflecting the importance of community and relations, researchers should consider proposing studies that address community, institutional, familial, peer network, or other factors that directly influence health outcomes or that impact individual's abilities to enact health preserving practices. This could include multi-level intervention approaches or addressing and reporting on changes in known contextual influences while intervening to create individual level change. However, the interventions should not be so intensive or time-consuming that they would exceed the resources of the participants/community to participate or affect sustainability. Please see the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework as one example (<a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/">https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/</a>).</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Future Clinical Trial Design Considerations:</strong> Investigators are encouraged to work with Tribal partners and communities to identify potential research designs that will provide robust evidence of intervention efficacy or effectiveness in the future clinical trial.&nbsp;Rigorous research designs are expected, but investigators are not required to conduct randomized controlled trials in the future trial.&nbsp;and to ensure that they have appropriate statistical expertise on the study team to address any non-independence or other potential sources of bias in the study design.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">If participants are assigned to study arms for the future trial, other potentially appropriate study designs with randomization include parallel group or cluster-randomized trials, individually randomized group-treatment trials, and stepped wedge group or cluster-randomized trials. When it is not possible to assign participants to study arms for the future trial, alternative rigorous research designs that provide robust evidence of intervention effectiveness include, but are not limited to, multiple baseline or repeated measures designs, interrupted time series studies, or stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials in which all subjects receive the intervention.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">In these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation, particularly for small samples where traditional experimental randomization is not possible without impacts on bias or contamination. Planning activities proposed under this NOFO may include working to incorporate such methods into the clinical trial protocol&nbsp;and research design.</p><h4>Research Objectives</h4><p>Participating NIH ICs have identified priority research areas below. Applicants are encouraged to speak with IC representatives for technical assistance (see Agency Contacts in Section VII).&nbsp;Applicant organizations with limited research experience are strongly encouraged to develop applications in collaboration with research organizations.</p><p><u>Applicants should ensure that the IC they wish to target participates in the IRINAH NOFO to which they wish to submit. Applications that do not align with the missions of any of the participating ICs will be considered non-repsonsive.&nbsp;</u></p><p><strong>National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)</strong></p><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is interested in culturally appropriate prevention, treatment, recovery, implementation, and dissemination research focused on substance use among Native adolescents and adults. NIDA is interested in a wide array of substances including but not limited to nicotine, psychostimulants/methamphetamines, opioids, cannabis, synthetic drugs, and psychoactive prescription drugs. Research at the intersection of HIV and substance use, including research that incorporates HIV prevention and/or care, also is welcome.&nbsp;Investigators are encouraged to propose research in urban, rural, and reservation settings and research that utilizes existing infrastructure, community resources, service systems (public and private), and health and wellness providers.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Special considerations</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">NIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drugabuse.gov%2Ffunding%2Fspecial-considerations-for-nida-funding&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cyvonne.walker%40nih.gov%7C2b30605ae50740cd31fb08dad6eab2e5%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C638058600752895551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=RZWNDnsvUK%2BgiMQdFmQN7h9cG6ADsnh51v0XvRnqG6k%3D&amp;reserved=0">Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards</a>.

NIAAA encourages research that engages AI/AN communities, considers native practices and concepts of health, and continues building a body of culturally appropriate research to address societal and cultural needs and health disparities. Such research can include, but is not limited to the following areas:</p><ul><li>Health promotion and alcohol use disorder (AUD) prevention, including interventions to reduce underage drinking and promote abstinence or reduction of alcohol use</li><li>Comprehensive, multicomponent, community-based environmental interventions that address alcohol misuse and co-occurring conditions</li><li>Interventions to reduce heavy alcohol use and binge-drinking</li><li>Interventions that integrate individuals, families, communities, and other local support institutions into the prevention, treatment, and AUD recovery process</li><li>Models and methods that enhance the diffusion, implementation, and adoption of evidence-based alcohol-related treatment practices across the full spectrum of services for individuals with AUD</li><li>Innovative health services research to understand and expand the availability and acceptability of existing alcohol prevention and treatment services or/and increase uptake in both rural and urban dwelling Native American populations&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</strong></p><p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is interested in both non-AIDS and AIDS-related mental health interventions and services research relevant to priorities described in this NOFO and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports"><u>NIMH Strategic Plan for Research</u></a>. Practice-relevant research that incorporates the perspectives of community and practice partners is encouraged. Applications that propose adaptations to existing interventions should provide an empirical rationale for the need and focus of the adaptation, consistent with <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/sites/default/files/documents/about/advisory-boards-and-groups/namhc/reports/fromdiscoverytocure.pdf"><u>NAMHC Workgroup Report</u></a> recommendations. Clinical trials <i>testing individual-level interventions</i> (i.e., the recipients are patients, family members, providers) must follow the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml"><u>NIMH experimental therapeutics approach</u></a> and provide a plan to evaluate target engagement, including: an empirical justification for the selected target mechanism(s), measures of the targets(s), and an analytic approach to evaluate whether changes in the targets(s) are associated with changes in the outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>Clinical trials testing <i>services interventions</i>, <i>policy interventions, and/or implementation strategies</i> must seek to understand how, why, for whom, and/or in what circumstances the intervention is effective, to ensure that the study results may be informative regardless of the primary outcomes. Approaches may include mediation analyses, moderator analysis, temporally organized dismantling designs, factorial designs, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to consult with the relevant NIMH Scientific/Research Contact early in the application process.</p><p><strong>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The mission of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. The NIEHS is interested in applications that support the initial development of a culturally appropriate clinical trial or research project in preparation for health promotion or disease prevention interventions addressing the health impacts of environmental exposures that disproportionately impact Native American populations. Examples of activities NIEHS will support with this R34 include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Developing inclusive research teams where Native American investigators and/or community members have significant leadership roles (e.g., key personnel, Multiple Principal Investigators);</li><li>Activities to establish and sustain authentic, trusted partnerships with tribal communities;</li><li>Activities to build capacities of academics and Native American partners to engage in collaborative research;</li><li>Co-development of research designs that respect Native American cultural values, are inclusive of Tribal Ecological Knowledge/Indigenous Knowledge, and are feasible in Native American communities;</li><li>Co-development of recruitment strategies, study protocols, data safety and data management and sharing plans, data analyses, and study milestones with Native American partners</li></ul><p><strong>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)</strong></p><p>The prevalence of oral diseases in Native American communities is among the highest in the U.S. Oral diseases share common behavioral and physiologic risk and protective factors with many other diseases and conditions, while those impacting health disparities and inequities are also known to be influenced by a range of social determinants of health such as education, employment, housing and food security, and distance to health care facilities. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) is interested in prognostic research to identify new upstream risk and protective factors of dental caries, periodontal disease, or oral and pharyngeal cancer, and their interactions with other common risk factors of comorbid conditions affecting Native American population; developmental/exploratory research to engage with Native American communities and design intervention strategies to address social determinants of health contributing to oral health disparities and inequities; pilot testing feasibility, acceptability, and scalability of evidence-based/community-informed intervention strategies to address oral health risk factors and overcome barriers for adaptation. These R34 projects should inform multi-disciplinary and community-based implementation research that will promote oral health and disease prevention across the lifespan in Native American populations through holistic and sustainable interventions.</p><p><strong>National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)</strong></p><p>The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) supports research to solve pressing health challenges and inform practice and policy - optimizing health and advancing health equity into the future. NINR discovers solutions to health challenges through the lenses of health equity, social determinants of health, population and community health, prevention and health promotion, and systems and models of care. Drawing on the strengths of nursing&#146;s holistic, contextualized perspective, core values, and broad reach, NINR funds multilevel and cross-sectoral research that examines the factors that impact health across the many settings in which nurses practice, including homes, schools, workplaces, clinics, justice settings, and the community. Observational, intervention, and implementation research are of interest.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The mission of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and integrative health interventions and their roles in improving health and health care. In the context of this NOFO, NCCIH is particularly interested in encouraging applications that develop and conduct pilot feasibility trials of culturally appropriate mind and body or natural product approaches for symptom management (e.g. pain, stress, anxiety, depression) or for health promotion and well-being in Native American populations.

			 <a id='_bookmark220688' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p><strong>Research Strategy</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">The Research Strategy should describe the significance of the proposed research in the context of the future efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation trial it is meant to inform. Applicants must provide evidence that the research question addressed is relevant to and prioritized by the Native American community partners for the study and that the project, if completed successfully, can improve the health of one or more Native American communities. Applicants should clearly articulate how their research builds fundamental knowledge relevant to Native American health. NIH&#146;s mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to use that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Through this initiative, fundamental knowledge includes findings that may be specific to a Native American community or group of communities, even if the outcomes may not generalize broadly. Fundamental knowledge may also be defined as principles for community engaged research, or methodological innovations.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Applicants must demonstrate innovation in their proposed research. Some examples of the types of innovations that may be included are the use of Indigenous Knowledge (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/</a>), research capacity development, novel research design and analysis, novel approaches to community engagement and/or participant recruitment, research to address the cultural appropriateness of standard measures or develop new measures, determination of culturally/clinically meaningful effect sizes for a future efficacy or effectiveness trial, or through the development or adaptation of interventions.</p><p><strong>Investigators</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Investigators, both those from research institutions and those who work with or in the community, must show relevant proficiency to conduct the proposed research, including proficiency for working with Native American partners and communities. Indications of proficiency might include research publications, efforts to build relationships and trust with communities, dissemination of information to Native American communities, personal engagement in community events, provision of training to communities, knowledge of community systems and settings, and leadership roles in the community. Productivity of community-based investigators may rely on a description of their proficiency in working within the community.</p><p><strong>Partnerships and collaborations</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">The community-researcher partnership must be documented in the Research Strategy section to describe the community's support for and involvement in development, design, testing, and dissemination of the study, including establishing a Community Advisory Board. If using CBPR research methods, these must be appropriately documented. The description of the community-research organization partnership must describe the scientific, logistic, and organizational responsibilities of each of the collaborators for each aspect of the proposed project. If building upon existing partnerships, the application should also describe the history of the partners in collaborating on prior research projects,&nbsp;or other mutually beneficial activities, the mutual understanding and cooperation among the partners, procedures for resolving disagreements, and the relative contributions to the previous and current projects.</p><p><strong>Approach</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Preliminary data:&nbsp;</strong>Applications to this NOFO are not required to present preliminary/pilot data in support of the proposed approaches, hypotheses and aims; rather, a well-defined theory of change, logic model, or cultural source and associated hypotheses are expected.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Specific justification must be provided for the necessity of all planning and intervention development activities proposed, including cultural adaptation of interventions or measures that have been used or validated with other populations. Research questions that have been addressed for other populations may still need to be specifically addressed for Native Americans if there is reason to believe that processes might operate differently for a Native American community or Native Americans more broadly. Appropriate justifications of scientific gaps areas must be provided in the applications. Justifications for the premise of the research can be established based on documentation from scientific and/or cultural sources.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Whenever possible, evidence should be included of the feasibility of planning and research activities proposed, including prior collaborations between the investigators and between the research team and study partners, prior experience working with the study population, and prior experience with the measures and methods to be used or tested in the research.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">When the research involves intervention development, adaptation, or acceptability and feasibility testing, the intervention (or the process of its initial development) must be described, including the theoretical and empirical evidence informing the intervention, the proposed mechanisms of action of the intervention, the health outcomes the intervention is meant to impact, and any relevant protective factors or risk factors that the intervention acts on or through for its hypothesized effects. When appropriate, the study should include plans for assessing fidelity of intervention and/or protocol implementation and/or plans for manualization or other standardization practices.The application must describe how the approach taken will support the future sustainability of the intervention, and any implications for implementing or disseminating the intervention if it is found to be effective in the future trial.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;">The pilot studies proposed under this NOFO may or may not require a comparison condition. If included, the application should describe and justify the nature of any comparison/control group (e.g., whether the comparison group will receive information only, minimal treatment, or delayed intervention or some other design). Applicants should consult with collaborating communities to discuss the appropriateness of the selected approach to the comparison group, as tribal leaders and community members may believe that comparison group members should receive something more than usual care.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Letters of Support</strong></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">Provide all appropriate letters of support, including those from community partners, collaborators, tribal resolutions, and others. Letters of support should describe the scientific, logistic, and organizational responsibilities of each of the collaborators for each aspect of the proposed project. The letter(s) of support should also describe the history of the partners in collaborating on prior research projects, or other mutually beneficial activities, the mutual understanding and cooperation among the partners, and the relative contributions to the previous projects.</p><ul><li>Each Native American organization that participates in the project should submit a letter of support.</li><li>Applications that represent a partnership between a research organization and one or more tribes or communities should include a resolution from each tribal or community government or equivalent document, specifying that the community or tribe agrees to participate as a partner in the project and will strongly support the project for its entire duration.</li><li>If the application includes a consortium of tribes or communities, applicants should provide a resolution of support from each tribe or community of the consortium.</li><li>If the applicant is a tribally sanctioned non-profit tribal organization, specific tribal resolution(s) of support will not be required if the current tribal resolution(s) under which the organization operates encompasses activities proposed in the application. A copy of the current operational resolution(s) must be submitted with the application.</li><li>In recognizing that Tribal governments are legal sovereign nations, potential partners should be informed that tribes may seek ownership or control of all data and all biological samples; therefore, universities and other partners should be prepared to negotiate data sharing and biological sample sharing agreements with tribes/Tribal government(s) as appropriate. If such an agreement is in place the applicant(s) should provide the letter of such an agreement with the application. Letters of Support should also explicitly stipulate that Tribes agree to respond expeditiously to requests for approval of the protocol, protocol modifications, approval of abstracts for presentation to scientific meetings, and approval of manuscripts for submission for publication in scientific journals. The time required for approving each of these (protocol, abstracts, manuscripts): 1) must be proposed and stated within the resolution of support, 2) may differ for each of these activities, 3) may be modified by study investigators only in consultation with the tribal/community leadership, and 4) should identify an individual or entity within the tribe or community to whom a request for waiver of the time requirement can be directed if circumstances arise. PD/PI(s) and tribes/communities are expected to publish scientific papers, present at scientific conferences/associations/meetings; and may also be expected to develop fact sheets/materials for dissemination to the tribe/community.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:25px;">If the applicant(s) is working with communities, tribes/tribal governments then community/tribal resolutions of support, or equivalent documents, should accompany the application whenever possible. However, tribal resolutions and letters of support from community collaborators may be submitted as post-submission material up to 30 days before the study section meeting. The date of the study section meeting will be posted in eRA after submission. <strong>Note that this flexibility is NOT&nbsp;extended to letters of support from Key Personnel and consultants with academic or research organization affiliations. </strong>Letters of support from personnel with academic or research organization affiliations must be submitted with the application (on either October due date for non-AIDs applications or the January due date for AIDs applications listed in the Key Dates table above).</p>

<p>ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain &#147;applicable clinical trials&#148; on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (<a href="https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/">https://register.clinicaltrials.gov</a>). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm</a></p>

<p>Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.</p>

<p>Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).</p>

<p>Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).</p>
