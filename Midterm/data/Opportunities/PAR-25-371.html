			 <a id='_bookmark220473' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genome.gov/2020SV">2020 NHGRI Strategic Vision</a> notes that &#147;genomics has become increasingly woven into the fabric of biomedical research, medical practice, and society&#148;&nbsp;and points to the continued importance&nbsp;of focusing on ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) research. As biomedical investigators are applying genomic knowledge and tools&nbsp;to study an expanding range of diseases and traits in a wide array of settings, novel ELSI questions continue to emerge.</p><p>Innovations in gene editing, gene therapy, polygenic risk scores, and genomic testing across various life stages continue. However, the use of new genomic technologies and information is not always preceded by confirmation of their validity, reliability or utility across populations. Sufficient evidence may be lacking to determine whether new innovations are transferrable across health care settings or valid in populations whose genomic data were not used in their discovery.&nbsp;Professional norms, systemic practices, and societal forces may affect the uptake of genomic medicine across communities. Furthermore, significant distribution and re-distribution of financial and genomic healthcare resources&nbsp;may be needed to achieve genomic equity in the United States and abroad.</p><p>Globally, genomic data are being generated, shared and commercialized in an array of settings from academic medical centers to the&nbsp;pharmaceutical industry to law enforcement. Fueled by advances in informatics and sequencing technologies, genomic data is increasingly merged with data from personal mobile health devices, electronic health records, direct-to-consumer tests, social media accounts, assays of environmental exposures, and geocoding systems. The size and scope of research datasets continue to grow, at the same time that broad data sharing has become standard scientific practice. In response, models of data ownership and data stewardship are under scrutiny and in flux. Assessing how governance strategies and technology can be used to ensure that genomic data are ethically sourced and responsibly shared remain considerable challenges.</p><p>Translating genomic research and data into fair and appropriate benefits for society presents another set of challenges. The relative dearth of genomic data collected from populations who remain understudied&nbsp; in biomedical research and underserved in the healthcare system&nbsp;threatens the just and equitable distribution of benefits from genomic innovation. Potential inequity may&nbsp;be exacerbated by the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to genomic data analysis. These methods will not produce accurate results if the data upon which they are trained lack broad representation. Efforts to help ensure that the human genome reference sequence and population-based genomic datasets better represent existing human genomic diversity and genetic ancestry are underway. However, evaluating and addressing the availability and quality of genomic information across different groups is an ongoing challenge.</p><p>Genomic information can have profound implications for how people understand themselves as individuals, and in relationship or contrast to others. History is replete with examples where the value and predictive nature of genomic information was overstated, misappropriated and weaponized to the detriment of targeted communities and to society more broadly. Such examples are often thought of as part of the field&#146;s troubled and distant past. However, intentional and unintentional misinterpretations and misuses of genomic research that disparage groups of people have resurfaced. Extreme examples are typified by people reimagining current genomic findings as justification for racist beliefs and actions. Other problematic examples include research suggesting that complex phenotypes such as hypertension, diabetes, and depression can be meaningfully explained by genomic factors without accounting for the effects of social determinants of health. The rise of oversimplified attributions of individual and group differences to genetic causes threatens the integrity of genomic science and research.</p><p>Overall, ongoing advancement and change in the conduct of genomic research and the translation of genomic science may require key stakeholders to revisit, revise and reiterate the norms and responsibilities that guide the field. New ELSI questions continue to arise about genomics while other questions endure, resurface, or are transformed. Yet, at the forefront of genomics remains an incredible array of opportunities to improve the health and wellbeing of &nbsp;people across all social and genetic backgrounds.</p><p><i>The purpose of this NOFO is to solicit applications for research projects that identify, examine, and address the ELSI of advances in genomics for individuals, families, communities, groups, institutions, and society.</i></p><p>To address the broad scope and reach of genomics and corresponding ELSI issues, applications are invited from investigators representing a wide range of academic disciplines, including, but not limited to,&nbsp;bioethics, the humanities (e.g., history, religion, philosophy, literature), behavioral and social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, communication science), law, genetic and genomic science, genetic counseling, clinical medicine, health services and implementation science research, health disparities and inequities research, health communication, public health, and data science.</p><p>Applications are encouraged from multidisciplinary investigator teams who represent a broad range of disciplines, lived experiences and perspectives.</p><p>Applications may propose studies using either single or mixed methods. Approaches may include, but are not limited to, conceptual, legal, and normative analyses, and empirical qualitative and quantitative methods. Applied research conducted to address real-world ELSI issues facing genomics or to facilitate the uptake of ELSI findings may also be proposed.</p><p>NIH encourages applicants to consider the use of variables provided in the <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phenxtoolkit.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cdave.kaufman%40nih.gov%7C407efe21b22e450294dd08db8e4098a7%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C638260180325409641%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ZpP%2BoSoKHh303hmAssYpVzdHhQyUK2Taxu2iMYx2gs8%3D&amp;reserved=0">PhenX Toolkit</a> which provides recommended standard measures for use in biomedical research.

Population descriptors may be used for example, to describe who is participating in a study, what groups are being compared, or to whom particular study findings may apply.&nbsp;</p><p>Descriptors measuring the complex concepts of race, ethnicity, genealogical ancestry and genetic ancestry are commonly employed in biomedical, health services, genomic and ELSI research. In the United States, there are real and measurable impacts of one&#146;s racial, ethnic or ancestral identity on health, wellness, and life experiences. It may be valid and valuable to use population descriptors in a given analytical context. However, in some cases socially constructed population descriptors like race and ethnicity are used as proxies for human genetic variation in genetic and genomic research, which can lead to conflation between social and biological groups and can cause harm (<a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/use-of-race-ethnicity-and-ancestry-as-population-descriptors-in-genomics-research" Title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">NASEM Report Using Population Descriptors in Genetics and Genomics Research</a>).</p><p>Similarly, sex, gender, gender identity and sexual orientation are complex, related constructs that are conceptually distinct (<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26424/measuring-sex-gender-identity-and-sexual-orientation" Title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">NASEM Consensus Report, Measuring Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation</a>). They are commonly studied aspects of human identity that impact health, access to health care services, and experiences with discrimination; however, they are often mismeasured and misrepresented in research. Investigators using sex- and gender-related population descriptors in their analyses must understand the distinctions between different measures and choose accordingly.</p><p>Overall, the scientific questions to be addressed should guide whether and which population descriptors are used in a given study. Investigators should use established theory, frameworks, or scientific evidence to inform their use of population descriptors. Investigators must consider which population descriptors measure the phenomena of interest, and whether other validated variables (e.g., <a href="https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/nih-sdohrcc#tabs2">social determinants of health</a>) may be more directly associated with those phenomena. The communities or groups involved in a study may have important insights about the most relevant descriptors to use. Investigators can consider collecting data on multiple descriptors of a concept, while also collecting only necessary data in pursuit of well-defined research goals.&nbsp;</p><p>To enhance the rigor and replication of proposed research, applications to this notice should be transparent in the Research Plan about the use of population descriptors. Applications should also be transparent about the use of race, ethnicity or ancestry as proxies for other contributing factors, and acknowledge the challenges and limitations of doing so.</p><p><strong>Community and Stakeholder Involvement</strong></p><p>There are a variety of communities and stakeholders whose knowledge, perspectives and experiences can inform and improve the field of genomics. Community or stakeholder involvement in any and all phases of a research project is encouraged where appropriate, but not required. For the purposes of this NOFO, the term &#147;community&#148; refers to "a group or groups of people affiliated by geographic proximity, special interest, or similar situations" (<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/communityengagement/pdf/PCE_Report_508_FINAL.pdf ">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</a>). The term &#147;stakeholders&#148; refers to &#147;individuals, organizations or communities that have a direct interest in the process and outcomes of a project, research or policy endeavor&#148; (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3371639/">Deverka et al. 2012</a>). Community and stakeholder involvement may include a range of methods or approaches that vary in level and intensity including, but not limited to, establishment of advisory boards or panels, stakeholder-driven research, community-oriented research, or community-based participatory research.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Areas of Research Interest</strong></p><p>The following research areas of interest have been identified by the participating ICOs.</p><p><strong>National Human Genome Research Institute</strong></p><p>The NHGRI is interested in research that addresses:</p><ul><li><i>Genomics and Sociocultural Structures and Values</i>: These projects may explore and elucidate the personal, social and cultural factors that shape the generation, interpretation, understanding and use of genetic and genomic information and associated technologies.</li><li><i>Genomics at the Institutional and System Level</i>: These projects may explore the interplay and influences between genetics and genomics and organizations, institutions, governments, systems or other organized stakeholders.</li><li><i>Genomic Research Design and Implementation</i>: These projects may investigate the ethical, legal, social and policy issues that arise in connection with the design and conduct of genetic and genomic research.</li><li><i>Genomic Healthcare:</i> These projects may examine issues that arise as genetic and genomic research are integrated into clinical medicine and healthcare in a variety of settings.</li></ul><p>Research which focuses on the acceptability and accessibility of genetics or genomics to all communities is highly encouraged, particularly communities that have been understudied, underserved and/or marginalized (treated as insignificant or peripheral) by research institutions or healthcare systems.&nbsp;These communities could include, but are not limited to <a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/nih-strategic-plan-definitions-and-parameters.html#:~:text=NIH%20defines%20health%20disparity%20populations,or%20more%20of%20these%20descriptions.">the health disparity populations defined by the NIH</a>.</p><p>Further detail on topics of interest is included on the NHGRI ELSI Research Domains website at:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/ELSI-Research-Program/domains">https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/ELSI-Research-Program/domains</a>. The examples provided here and online serve as a general guide to areas of importance and should not be viewed as a comprehensive list of research topics. Applicants are encouraged to propose topics and issues that are ripe for research, especially given rapid advances in genomic science and continued growth in the interpretation and use of genomic information.</p><p>Research projects may develop tools and findings that can be applied across many diseases and conditions. Projects focused on a single disease or disorder may be of lower priority for NHGRI unless generalizability or transferability of findings and resources is clearly demonstrated and described.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>National Cancer Institute</strong></p><p>The NCI is interested in research that focuses on the ethical, legal, and/or social implications of genetics and genomics in cancer-related research, care, and public health contexts; with additional emphasis on incorporating&nbsp;populations understudied in cancer research&nbsp;and addressing cancer disparities. In particular, the NCI is interested in the following:</p><ul><li>Studies on the ethical, regulatory, and policy challenges in cancer research involving genetic and genomic information (e.g., clinical oncology trials, population-based studies, observational studies, etc.);

NIEHS is interested in environmental justice and health disparities issues associated with the identification of vulnerable populations in G x E studies and the incorporation of social determinants of health into the G x E research framework. The potential evolving ELSI issues associated with developing improved health risk assessments that leverage emerging findings from combined epigenomics, exposomics, and genomics research is particularly welcome. Identifying, developing,&nbsp;and testing strategies for responsibly reporting back health results from research on G x E interactions to study participants is relevant.

These studies should consider differences in cultural practices and values across different communities.</li><li>Use of genomics in Precision Medicine, both for clinical and personal decision making, including indications favoring specific interventions (e.g. genetic testing that suggests favoring biological rather than psychosocial interventions; pharmacogenomic testing favoring higher-risk treatments as potentially more effective than those with lower risk; absence/presence of genetic finding discouraging providers from considering all available treatment options).</li><li>Effects on the legal and regulatory landscape and existing structural inequalities. (e.g. avoiding discrimination in employment, housing, military service, etc. based on genetic risk of mental disorder and/or use of preventive interventions or services).</li></ul></li><li>Studies on ethical, legal, and social implications raised by the collection, storage, and future research uses of biological samples and genetic data collected for neuropsychiatric research (e.g. participant preferences, informed consent, governance, privacy and security, and data sharing)<ul><li>Risk assessment is needed for how changes in the science of a neuropsychiatric disease would impact the research subject community (i.e. those living with the disorder and their families who have contributed data or samples to prior research) with respect to informed consent. An example is the increased understanding of the genetic interrelatedness of neuropsychiatric disorders, pleiotropy and locus heterogeneity as it applies to consent for use in related disorder research. Assessment is needed to determine how such a change can most easily be appreciated by the study population and research subject community at large, and how these changes impact subjects understanding of informed consent and the ability to share data and samples.</li><li>Investigations relating to ethical and cultural issues raised by collections of data and samples from vulnerable and underserved populations in US, including Tribal communities, and populations in different cultural contexts in LMICs, whose populations may be the focus of increased recruitment efforts for neuropsychiatric research.</li></ul></li></ul><p>NIMH encourages projects that will partner with/embed within existing large-scale psychiatric genetics research efforts and others global research network to facilitate answering questions relevant to the execution of that research and implementation of the findings.

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply- Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>

The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code.

	<ul>
		<li><a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11176">NATO Commercial and Government Entity (NCAGE) Code</a> &ndash; Foreign organizations must obtain an NCAGE code (in lieu of a CAGE code) in order to register in SAM.</li>

If new human biospecimens will be collected, or if clinical application is included in the application, the consent process should be described at a high level in the Research Plan and detailed in the Human Subjects Section.</p><p>NHGRI strongly encourages studies that propose to derive genomic data from human specimens and cell lines to obtain participant consent either for general research use through controlled access or for unrestricted access. Similarly, consent language should avoid both restrictions on the types of users who may access the data and restrictions that add additional requirements to the access request process. NHGRI acknowledges that this will not always be possible or appropriate. In addition, individual participants who do not consent to future research use or broad sharing of their data (i.e., submission of their data to a publicly accessible data repository) may still participate in the primary study if consistent with study design. Additional guidance on informed consent can be found in the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Informed-Consent#resource">NHGRI Informed Consent Resource</a>.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to get feedback from the communities in which the research will be performed regarding plans for how individual level data resulting from the research projects will be shared with the scientific community for research purposes.

<p>ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain &#147;applicable clinical trials&#148; on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (<a href="https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/">https://register.clinicaltrials.gov</a>). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm</a></p>

<p>Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.</p>

<p>Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at <a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm</a> and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).</p>

<p>Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).</p>
