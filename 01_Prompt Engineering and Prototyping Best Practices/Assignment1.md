2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points: It is through the means of communication that I can share my values, thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and experiences with others. Face-to-face communication allows me to use both verbal and nonverbal cues, making it the richest and most powerful form of communication. According to Dobkin and Pace (2006), verbal communication consists of ‚Äúmessages expressed through a formal language, using oral, written, or signed words‚Äù (p. 14). Nonverbal communications are ‚Äúmessages expressed through symbols other than words, including hand gestures, facial expressions, touching, vocal inflection, and clothing‚Äù (Dobkin & Pace, 2006, p.14). The access to nonverbal cues in face-to-face communications creates bonding and adds intimacy to my personal relationships. Expressing love through touch or looking into someone‚Äôs eyes to display affection are examples of the power of nonverbal communication. Additionally, nonverbal cues decrease chances of misunderstanding in my interactions with others, and have a vital role in expressing my feelings and perceiving emotions in others.

5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone: I decided to write an extended essay on how hip-hop works as protest of the lower classes because I think the music is cool and really gets people dancing, inspiring those people who wouldn't normally think there's any point in being against anything to listen to the message. Being an enthusiastic hip-hop dancer myself,I really wanted to find out some more about this.

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
