            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe proposed 5-year K23 award describes a research training program for Kristina Suorsa-Johnson, PhD, a\nlicensed pediatric psychologist who specializes in differences of sex development (DSD). Her overarching\ncareer goal is to become an independently funded investigator focused on improving the psychosocial and\nhealth outcomes of pediatric patients with DSD by creating tools to facilitate patient engagement in medical\ndecision making through shared decision making (SDM). This award provides support for Dr. Suorsa-Johnson\nto achieve the following Career Development Aims: Aim 1: Obtain expertise in SDM, including the\ndevelopment of decision aids (DAs) for adolescents and young adults (AYAs); Aim 2: Gain sexual health\neducation training, particularly as it relates to the creation of educational materials to enhance surgical SDM;\nAim 3: Develop expertise in evaluating and implementing DAs; and Aim 4: Expand and strengthen research\nleadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson has assembled a dedicated\nteam of mentors and advisors with expertise in SDM (Angela Fagerlin, PhD), SDM in AYAs (Ellen Lipstein,\nMD), sexual health education (Jordan Rullo, PhD), dissemination and implementation science (Jennie Hill,\nPhD), qualitative design and clinical trials (Melissa Watt, PhD and Angela Fagerlin, PhD), multi-site trial design\n(Gregory Stoddard, MBA, MPH), urogenital/gonadal surgeries in AYAs (Kathleen van Leeuwen, PhD), and\nDSD education (David Sandberg, PhD and Erica Weidler, MEd, MS). A person with lived experience, Noi\nLiang, MBA, MCPA, is consulting to ensure all aspects of the project align with the needs of those with DSD.\nDSD are congenital conditions where chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex development is atypical. AYAs\nwith DSD make critical and potentially irreversible, life-altering urogenital/gonadal surgical decisions. However,\nwe know little about how AYAs approach surgical decision making and no standardized SDM resources exist.\nAs such, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson proposes to create and pilot a set of surgical DAs for AYAs with DSD. This will\nbe achieved through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify informational needs and values influencing surgical\ndecision making for AYAs with DSD; Aim 2: Develop a set of evidence-based DAs for surgical decisions to\nfacilitate SDM for AYAs and their caregivers; and Aim 3: Pilot test and refine DA content, delivery, and\nfeasibility. This project will result in a set of surgical decision aids ready to be tested in a multi-site trial.\nThis project is significant because it will change how we provide care and improve engagement in surgical\ndecision making for this underserved, NIH-designated sexual and gender minority subpopulation. This\ninnovative project is the first to explore the needs of AYAs with DSD making surgical decisions from a SDM\nframework and create associated decision support tools.",

To fill this gap, the proposed research will examine the decisional needs of\nadolescents and young adults with differences of sex development, as well as develop and pilot a set of\nsurgical decision aids addressing identified needs. Standardized decision aid use will promote adolescent and\nyoung adult engagement in shared decision making, leading to improved care, patient health, and\npsychosocial outcomes.",

As the Data Coordination Resource Center,\nwe will continue to work collaboratively with each ERN study team and the other HEAL ERN Resource Centers\nto 1) develop, implement and monitor the ERN trials; 2) help respond to issues/protocol changes that emerge\nduring trial implementation and initiate timely necessary changes to assure trial success; 3) provide collection\nand analysis of data; and 4) assist with timely publication of study results. Our supplement application has two\nSpecic Aims: Specifc Aim 1: Work with ERN investigators and other HEAL ERN Resource Centers to provide\ncollaborative clinical trial expertise and assistance in study and protocol design, single IRB, study implementation\nand management, accrual of subjects, interim study reporting, nal study analyses, and assistance with timely\npublication and dissemination of study results. Specific Aim 2: Provide comprehensive data management for\ncurrent and new ERN trials, including database and data collection systems, data management plans, data\nrisk assessment and quality control, implementation of randomization, assistance with Data Safety Monitoring\nBoard (DSMB) reports, and training for using the data collection systems. Additionally, we will facilitate sharing\nof data from HEAL/ERN trials by incorporating HEAL Common Data Elements(CDEs) into protocols, continuing\nto support NIH program staff in development of HEAL CDEs, continued participation in the HEAL Collective\nBoard, and preparation of nal data sets suitable for deposit in NIH-designated repositories for incorporation into\nthe HEAL Data Ecosystem. Our continued collaboration with ERN investigators and integration with the other\nResource Centers will maximize the likelihood of successful and timely completion of the HEAL ERN clinical\ntrials, leading to translation of research ndings to the effective management of acute and chronic pain, while\nminimizing addictive opioid dosing regimens.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nHereditary deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT, E.C. 2.7.7.12) activity in humans\ncan lead to a potentially lethal disease called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Despite the life-saving\nconsequences of newborn screening, early diagnosis, and a galactose-restricted diet, affected women\ninvariably show ovarian damage and fertility impairment representing the greatest burden of their disease.\nThere are currently no satisfactory treatments available to prevent this complication. Recently, insights into\nthe underlying pathophysiology and innovative technological advancements have become available, and\noptions for curative treatment have emerged. Using this momentum, we aim to develop a treatment to\nprevent fertility impairments. We aim to 1) develop a non-viral nucleic acid therapy approach that targets the\novary and 2) determine the optimal timing to rescue the ovarian function. Folliculogenesis is driven by the\ncross-talk between oocytes and granulosa cells. Restoration of GALT activity in these cells could possibly\nrescue the ovarian damage.\nIn this pilot grant application, we will explore a new modality of gene therapy using nanoparticles\nencapsulating episomal GALT cDNA within a non-viral expression vector. This will include determination of\nthe optimal cationic polymer layer for delivery of episomal DNA plasmids expressing GFP or GALT to\ngranulosa cell lines and the addition of ligands to encourage uptake and promote specificity.\nIn addition, we will determine the optimal window of opportunity for this treatment. A prenatal origin has been\nconsidered for decades whereas the data currently available, albeit scarce, favor a postnatal origin. There is\nundoubtedly early damage, but whether treatments aimed to prevent ovarian damage needs to be started in\nthe neonatal period, or treating in infancy or adolescence would suffice, is not clear. This will be studied using\nthe zebrafish model for classic galactosemia that mimics the fertility impairments and is suitable for studies\nthrough development. Zebrafish reproduction is regulated by the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis, comparable\nto the human situation. For this purpose, RNA-seq, histology/immunohistochemistry of follicole\ndevelopment and single cell RNA-seq of oocytes and granulosa cells at 4 developmental stages will\nbe studied. These studies will uncover developmental stage and cell-specific alterations in the affected\novaries. Distinctive patterns at the different stages are expected to reveal at which stage(s) damage\ncan be prevented/halted using ovary targeted gene therapy.",

Job, a clinical pharmacologist and young\ninvestigator pursuing patient-oriented clinical research into how pregnancy and chronic disease\ninfluences drug disposition and action. This K23 award will provide Dr. Job with support necessary for\ncareer development in the following areas: (1) advanced pharmacometric techniques; (2) pregnancy\nand maternal-fetal science; (3) clinical trial design and management in pregnant populations; and (4)\nleading an interdisciplinary research program. By acquiring these skills, Dr. Job will fulfill her career\ngoal of becoming an independent investigator who advances clinical care by integrating physiology\nand pharmacology into approaches for designing, conducting, and interpreting clinical trials in\npregnant individuals. To achieve these goals, Dr. Job has assembled a mentoring team comprising a\nprimary mentor, Dr. Kevin Watt, an expert in PBPK modeling in special populations, and co-mentors,\nDr. Torri Metz, a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine and clinical research, Dr. Christina Chambers,\nan expert in epidemiology of drugs during pregnancy and health outcomes, and Dr. Andr\u00e9 Dallmann,\na leader in physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling in pregnant populations.\nAsthma is the most common chronic condition associated with pregnancy and affects up to 300,000\npregnancies every year in the United States. Asthma drugs are critical for achieving and maintaining\nproper control of asthma symptoms. The pharmacokinetics of these drugs can be affected by the\naltered physiology and lead to unacceptable drug-related toxicity or treatment failure. Progressive\nchanges to physiology occur throughout pregnancy. In the current proposal, Dr. Kathleen Job will\ndetermine optimal dosing of two common asthma medications in pregnant individuals. In Aim 1, she\nwill develop maternal-fetal PBPK models for these asthma medications. In Aim 2, she will evaluate\nmodel predictions with data from prospective clinical pharmacokinetic studies in pregnant individuals\nwith asthma. In Aim 3, she will develop pharmacodynamic models for the drugs of interest in pregnant\nindividuals with asthma with data collected as part of the prospective clinical pharmacokinetic studies\nin pregnant individuals. Findings will inform a Phase II/III Phase II/III safety and efficacy trial in\npregnant individuals with asthma and build a platform that can be applied to dosing of any drug at any\nstage of pregnancy. This research will prepare Dr. Job to design and implement scientifically rigorous\nand ethical drug trials in pregnant populations.",

            "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nChildren with medical complexity (CMC) are the most vulnerable of children with chronic diseases, who have\ncomplex, multisystem chronic diseases affecting \u22653 organ systems, severe functional limitations and technology\ndependencies. CMC have high health care needs, and account for 40% of hospitalized children and 35% of all\npediatric health care costs. Due to high medical fragility, CMC have frequent acute deteriorations superimposed\non their chronic conditions, leading to recurrent emergency department (ED)/hospital admissions and affecting\nquality of life (QOL). To reduce ED/hospital admissions for CMC, remote monitoring is suggested, with use of\nmHealth apps to regularly assess their health status remotely and identify early signs of acute deterioration,\nallowing for early interventions to prevent ED/hospital admissions. Yet no app to support remote monitoring of\nCMC exists. Variable, multisystem conditions among CMC make it difficult to develop an app. Also, many CMC\nare at high-risk for health care inequities, with minorities having higher unmet needs, but the impacts of health\ncare inequities and social determinants of health (SDOH) on ED/hospital admissions in CMC are rarely studied.\nFortunately, ED/hospital admissions for CMC are often preceded by a limited set of shared (crosscutting) acute\nsymptoms. These crosscutting symptoms rarely occur suddenly. Studies suggest that they usually start as subtle\nsigns, often unnoticed by parents until they escalate to prompt an ED/hospital visit. Thus, crosscutting symptoms\noffer an opportunity for a novel and practical approach for developing a remote monitoring app for CMC,\ndespite their multiple, variable underlying conditions. In a focus group, parents identified the crosscutting\nsymptoms that most often preceded their children\u2019s hospital admissions, and conveyed their needs, preferences\nand key functionalities that led to MyChildCMC, the first app designed to monitor and identify early signs of\ncrosscutting symptoms in CMC. In a pilot trial of 50 subjects, we confirmed feasibility of MyChildCMC use by\nparents, ability to detect early signs 2-14 days prior to ED/hospital admissions, and use leading significantly to\nfewer hospital days than controls. The current study will assess the efficacy and sustainability of MyChildCMC\nin a fully-powered 6-month, 2-arm (MyChildCMC vs usual care) trial of CMC (age 1-18 years) and their parents.\nParents assigned to MyChildCMC will use the app daily for 6 months, both arms will receive financial incentive\nfor participation, then we will stop the incentive and follow subjects for 6 more months to assess sustainability at\n12 months. We will also assess if MyChildCMC use will help reduce or eliminate inequities in ED/hospital\nadmissions. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine MyChildCMC\u2019s efficacy on 1.a. Child (ED/hospital use, hospital\ndays and QOL) and 1.b. Parent (satisfaction, self-efficacy and stress) outcomes; 2) Compare ED/hospital use\namong racial/ethnic and SDOH subgroups to assess potential effect of MyChildCMC on inequities; 3) Use mixed\nmethods to identify child and parent factors associated with MyChildCMC\u2019s use adherence and sustainability.",
