		<div class=" col-md-8 datacolumn">
                <p style="margin-left:0in;">The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage innovative pilot research that will inform and support the delivery of high-quality, continuously improving mental health services to benefit the greatest number of individuals with, or at risk for developing, a mental illness. This announcement invites applications for non-clinical&nbsp;trial pilot projects that address NIMH strategic priorities to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research as described in <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports">Goal 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan</a>.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Proposed research should seek to: 1) Identify mutable factors that impact access, continuity, utilization, quality, value, and outcomes, including disparities in outcomes, or scalability of mental health services, which may serve as targets in future service delivery intervention development, 2) Develop and test new research tools, technologies, measures, or methods and statistical approaches to study these issues, and 3) Test the feasibility of integrating and analyzing large data sets to understand factors affecting mental health services outcomes using advanced computational and predictive analytic approaches.4) Wherever possible, leverage existing infrastructure and partnerships to accomplish these goals.</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220473' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The healthcare landscape in the United States and globally is constantly changing, creating new challenges to the delivery of high-quality treatments and services to children, youth, adults, and older adults with unmet or under-met mental health needs. Epidemiological findings suggest that approximately one-half of the United States population meets lifetime criteria for a mental illness, and approximately one-fifth of people over 18 years old meet criteria in any given year. However, only one-half of people with any mental health disorders and only two-thirds of adults with a serious mental health disorder received mental health services in the previous year. Among young adults with serious mental illness, approximately half received mental health services in the previous year. Of those who find their way into mental health care, many quickly fall out of care and/or do not receive guideline-concordant treatment. Statistics for low- and middle-income countries (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9185671/">LMICs)</a> show even lower rates of treatment. Health disparities among certain populations (e.g., members of racial, ethnic, sexual and gender minority communities), a fragmented healthcare system, provider shortages, healthcare affordability, and other factors moderate these findings. Innovative mental health services research is needed to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, efficiency, and value of mental health services, and to bring effective strategies to scale to maximize public health impact.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Research Scope and Opportunities</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is intended to foster pilot mental health services research in strategic but understudied areas where new knowledge has the potential for high public health impact. This NOFO supports non-clinical trials research, including but not limited to&nbsp; natural experiments (that are not clinical trials), survey or mixed methods research, clinical epidemiology, and development and refinement of new research methods, measures, financing approaches, or statistical approaches related to mental health services research. Services research can target patients, providers, healthcare leaders and administrators, and/or healthcare systems or other organizations that provide services to persons with mental disorders, including those with early psychosis or autism spectrum disorders across the lifespan. NIMH encourages investigators to design their applications to maximize the likelihood that findings will meaningfully inform future research and/or be translated rapidly into practice, whether at the patient, clinical, healthcare/other system, or policy level. Studies involving providers, technologies, and workflows that generate results that can inform future studies of implementation in routine care settings are encouraged. Studies&nbsp;(using non trial designs) that are seeking to develop, refine, or evaluate services or system interventions, should employ methods that seek to understand how, why, for whom, and/or in what circumstances the intervention may be effective.&nbsp; That is, methodology should go beyond evaluating simply whether an intervention is effective. Studies that evaluate interventions must not employ </span><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/clinical-trials#:~:text=A%20research%20study%20in%20which%20one%20or%20more,outcomes.%20the%20NIH%20definition%20of%20a%20clinical%20trial.">NIH-defined clinical trial designs</a> (e.g., must not prospectively assign participants to one or more interventions). &nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">NIMH encourages investigators to develop and leverage strong research-practice partnerships with public and private stakeholders, so that the research follows a deployment-focused model of services design and testing. Deployment-focused studies consider the perspective of relevant stakeholders and key characteristics of settings intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. This attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure that resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are feasible and scalable, and to ensure that the research results will have utility for end users. Such stakeholders include, but are not limited to, federal agencies (e.g., <a href="https://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>, <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>, <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/">Health Resources and Services Administration</a>, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/">U.S. Department of Defense</a>, <a href="https://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>); state agencies, including state Medicaid leadership; commercial health insurers and/or funders; public and commercial disability insurers; employers and other payers; delivery systems; professional and/or trade associations; accrediting and licensing organizations; medical education and other clinician training programs; clinicians; vendors of information technology and other relevant products and/or services; service users; family members; and community organizations or comparable institutions and stakeholders in LMICs. Such communication and collaboration will ensure findings are relevant and practical, create opportunities for research that is not otherwise feasible, and enable stakeholders to anticipate relevant research initiatives in their planning and activities.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Given the critical need for practice-relevant research in community and practice settings, collaborations between academic investigators and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. When possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the NIMH-sponsored Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) and the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/research-initiatives/early-psychosis-intervention-network-epinet">EPINET</a>); <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/research-initiatives/advanced-laboratories-for-accelerating-the-reach-and-impact-of-treatments-for-youth-and-adults-with-mental-illness-alacrity">NIMH-sponsored ALACRITY Research Centers</a>; NIMH-sponsored suicide research centers <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/cgmhr/scaleuphubs">NIMH-sponsored Scale-Up Hubs</a>; electronic medical records, administrative databases, patient registries, institutions with Clinical and Translational Science Awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment, data collection and management.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">NIMH is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. Accordingly, this NOFO encourages pilot research on innovative service delivery models that seek to reduce disparities in service access, quality, and outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons and other underserved groups.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Under this NOFO, NIMH seeks pilot mental health services research applications that align with<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports"> Goal 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan<u> for Research</u></a>. Examples of high priority research include, but are not limited to, the following.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Research improving the efficiency, reach, and clinical impact of existing mental health services:</p><ol><li>Developing and evaluating performance feedback systems, decision support tools, and quality improvement processes, which can be utilized across a range of systems (e.g., primary care, schools, criminal justice system, child welfare agencies) or levels within a single system to optimize the delivery of effective mental health interventions.</li><li>Developing pragmatic, valid, and reliable measures of intervention fidelity, quality, and treatment outcomes, including outcome-focused quality measures, that can be applied at the patient, clinician, clinic, system, and/or population levels.</li><li>Identifying mutable factors, including patient, provider, organizational, and policy-level factors, to include social determinants of health, that are likely to influence disparities in healthcare access, continuity, quality, and mental health outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved groups. Social determinants of health include, but are not limited to, housing, food security, employment, social contact, and education.&nbsp; Social determinants of health may be operationalized in multi-level terms. These identified factors should serve as targets for future intervention development and testing.</li><li>Investigating alternative financing mechanisms, service purchasing mechanisms, inclusion in publicly funded benefit baskets, policies, regulations, and healthcare system rules, to include provider- or payer-level incentives, that promote high value (e.g., clinically effective and efficient) care, including integrated medical and psychosocial treatment approaches, and discourage low-value services.</li><li>Evaluating existing strategies&nbsp;to enhance treatment engagement and adherence (e.g., shared decision-making or behavioral economic approaches to behavior change).</li></ol><p style="margin-left:0in;">Research that informs the expeditious adoption, scaling, sustained implementation, and continuous quality improvement of evidence-based mental health or autism services as part of a learning healthcare system:</p><ol><li>Improving the dissemination, implementation, and delivery of evidence-based prevention and treatment practices in community mental health centers and non-specialty care settings (e.g., primary medical care, schools, online and virtual communities).</li><li>Examining mutable patient-, provider-, organizational-, and policy-level factors that influence the degree to which evidence-based interventions are implemented with fidelity, and sustained over time, to include mutable factors that influence sustainment after the research project period has ended.</li><li>Systematic, data-guided quality improvement activities that rigorously examine mental health care processes and outcomes within healthcare systems, to inform potential strategies that could lead to rapid, durable, and generalizable improvements in access and continuity of services, quality of care, and mental health outcomes at the individual and population-level.</li><li>Designing and/or validating instruments to measure dissemination, implementation, or sustainability processes; changes in service user functioning or provider practice over time; or organizational or systems processes related to access and continuity of services, quality of care, and mental health outcomes at the individual and population levels.</li><li>Employing studies (with quasi-experimental or quality improvement designs and methodologies that are not clinical trials) that simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of mental health services to enhance the delivery of evidence-based mental health practices and improve implementation of mental health services to enhance the delivery of evidence-based mental health practices and improve implementation outcomes (e.g., fidelity, acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, penetration, and sustainability of services).</li></ol><p style="margin-left:0in;">Research on innovative service delivery models to reduce or eliminate known health disparities related to race, ethnicity, geography, sexual and gender minority status and/or socioeconomic status, to dramatically improve outcomes in understudied populations in diverse United States and global communities, and to ensure high value mental health services are readily accessible to those in need:</p><ol><li>Using innovative technologies (e.g., mobile devices, health information systems, social networking platforms) to improve early detection of mental illnesses, engaging and connecting service users to evidence-based care, and increasing the reach, clinical impact, and scalability of services for underserved populations in diverse settings.</li><li>Developing and examining strategies for delivering evidence-based mental health services in non-specialty settings (e.g., primary care, criminal justice system, community-based programs providing mental health services to military or veteran populations, colleges or other academic settings, the child welfare system, or geriatric service settings), and leveraging those strategies to bolster the delivery of high-quality evidence-based care in specialty care settings.</li><li>Investigating the role of peer specialists to improve access, engagement, and effectiveness of services for people with mental illnesses, with or without co-occurring medical and other conditions. This research may address related issues such as optimal integration of peer specialist staff in service delivery systems and financing of such services.</li><li>Studying service delivery models that fully integrate treatment for mental illnesses with primary medical care, including medical decision models for treating mental illnesses and multiple chronic conditions.</li><li>Using non-clinical trial methodology (e.g., natural experiments) to evaluate service delivery models for comorbid conditions, such as care decision models that integrate treatment for mental illness and medical conditions, including service delivery interventions to identify, prevent, and reduce modifiable health risks associated with premature mortality in people with serious mental illnesses.</li></ol><p style="margin-left:0in;">Research to evaluate the public health impact of mental health services or autism services innovation using large representative data sets and novel computational approaches:</p><ol><li>Using electronic health record data to examine the clinical epidemiology, service utilization, response to treatment, and health state transitions of people with mental health needs within or across large systems responsible for mental health service delivery.</li><li>Monitoring real-time trends in suicidal behavior, serious mental illness, and other mental illnesses that generally go unrecognized in health care and other settings (e.g., school, work, and home) and promoting effective data-driven planning to improve detection and help seeking in these populations.</li><li>Developing and using big data and commensurate analytic approaches (e.g., predictive analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, large language models, etc.) for the purposes of understanding concentrations of risk and optimizing mental health care.</li><li>Developing, refining, or applying new methodological and computational approaches for the analysis of complex and dynamic systems affecting mental health outcomes, with the goal of demonstrating the impact of such factors on client outcomes.</li><li>Developing sampling frames and leveraging/enhancing existing epidemiological datasets to understand mental health needs in treatment seeking and general populations.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO.</strong></p><p>The following types of studies are not responsive to this NOFO. Applications proposing such studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed or considered for funding.</p><ul><li>Applications that do not include mental health services research.</li><li>Applications whose scope of work primarily involves the provision of direct services (e.g., the creation of a clinic or center).</li><li>Applications that have no clearly articulated relevance to people with or who are at risk for mental illness or autism spectrum disorder.</li><li>Studies focused on stigma or health literacy that examine knowledge about or attitudes towards mental health and mental health care without also examining mental health policy, actual service access, engagement, quality and/or outcomes of care.</li><li>Applications that propose a clinical trial.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;">Mental health services research questions that require a clinical trial design must be submitted via the appropriate NIMH Clinical Trials Funding Opportunity Announcement (see <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas">Support for Clinical Trials at NIMH</a>).

			 <p><strong>Applicant Organizations</strong></p>

<p>Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the How to Apply- Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. Failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission, please reference the&nbsp;<a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82423">NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>

The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code.

	<ul>
		<li><a href="//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11176">NATO Commercial and Government Entity (NCAGE) Code</a> &ndash; Foreign organizations must obtain an NCAGE code (in lieu of a CAGE code) in order to register in SAM.</li>

All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Management and Sharing Plan.</li></ul><p>To advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded by NIMH under this NOFO are expected to share those data via the&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive</a>&nbsp;(NDA; see&nbsp;<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-23-100.html">NOT-MH-23-100</a>). Established by the NIH, NDA is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. NDA links data across research projects through its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) and Data Dictionary technology. Investigators funded under this NOFO are expected to use these technologies to submit data to NDA.</p><p>To accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a GUID for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. The <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">NDA</a> website provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1)&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/contribute_cost_estimation.html">t</a><a href="https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/contribute-data.html#cost">he NDA Data Submission Cost Model&nbsp;</a>which offers a customizable Excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the Program Director/Principal Investigator and Data Manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the NDA's&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/contribute-data.html">Data Contribution page</a>. Investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this NOFO prior to submission to NDA and review their data for accuracy after submission. Submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every January 15 and July 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/sharing-regimen.html">NDA Sharing Regimen</a>&nbsp;for more information); Investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied.For more guidance on submitting data to NDA, refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">NDA Data Management and Sharing Plan on the NDA website</a>. NDA staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/data_dictionary.html">NDA Data Dictionary</a>.&nbsp;</p>

			 <a id='_bookmark220546' tabindex='-1' aria-hidden='true'></a><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research</strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Many NIH ICs encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal" (<a href="http://cde.nih.gov/">http://cde.nih.gov/</a>) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">NIMH expects investigators for this funding announcement to collect Common Data Elements (CDEs) for mental health human subjects research. Unless NIMH stipulates otherwise during the negotiation of the terms and conditions of a grant award, this Notice applies to all grant applications involving human research participants. The necessary funds for collecting and submitting these CDE data from all research participants to the <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/">NIMH Data Archive (NDA)</a> should be included in the requested budget. A cost estimator (<a href="https://nda.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/Documents/NDA_Data_Submission_Costs.xlsx">https://nda.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/Documents/NDA_Data_Submission_Costs.xlsx</a>) is available to facilitate the calculation of these costs. NIMH may seek further information regarding CDEs prior to award. Additional information about CDEs can be found at the<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/managing-your-grant/nimh-data-management-and-sharing-for-applicants-and-awardees"> NIMH webpage on Data Management and Sharing for Applicants and Awardees.</a></p>
