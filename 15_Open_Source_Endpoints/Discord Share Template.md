# 3 Lessons Learned

1. Hugging Face inference endpoints are easy to configure and a great resource for open-source solutions.
2. Don't leave your endpoints running unintentionally or else you will be charged.
3. Right size your hardware to your model.

# 3 Lessons Not Learned

1. Specific right-sizing strategies.
2. Cost monitoring solutions for the resources being used.
3. How to implement additional guardrails within the application itself to further ensure sensitive data remains protected.
