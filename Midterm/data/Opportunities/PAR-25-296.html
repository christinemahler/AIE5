The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has the unique charge of examining the translational research ecosystem at a systems level to determine where common pitfalls exist in the translational process and developing innovative solutions that will ultimately benefit research across a range of diseases and conditions. This disease-agnostic approach to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of all translational research is known as translational science, which focuses on building the evidence base for effective scientific and operational approaches in translational research. NCATS conducts and supports research in the science of translation to discover the scientific, mechanistic, and operational principles of the intervention development and dissemination processes, thereby providing the scientific foundation for improvements in translational efficiency that will accelerate the realization of interventions that improve human health.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">To do this, NCATS relies on the power of data, bold new methods, technologies, boundary-crossing partnerships, community and stakeholder engagement, and multi-disciplinary team science to develop, demonstrate, disseminate and sustainably implement innovative healthcare solutions to make biomedical research advancements more impactful for patients and communities.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>CTSA Program</strong></h4><p>The CTSA Program is one component of the NCATS&#146; Strategic Plan to advance CTS; it is designed to develop and implement innovative solutions that will improve the efficiency, quality, and impact of the process for turning observations in the laboratory, clinic, and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and communities. The expertise, resources, and infrastructure of the CTSA Program facilitate innovation and provide support for all scientific/medical communities engaged in CTS research, including disease and condition-specific research supported by NIH Institutes and Centers. As one of the largest NIH clinical and translational science programs and an exemplar of team science, NCATS envisions the CTSA Program progressing toward a standards-based, interoperable network in a cloud environment where informatics assets (e.g., data, software, and algorithms) can be co-developed and shared across the CTSA consortium in a common repository. The CTSA Program goals are to:</p><ol><li>Advance CTS: develop, demonstrate, and disseminate scientific and operational innovations that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical translation from identification to first-in-human studies to medical practice implementation to community health dissemination.</li><li>Promote partnerships and collaborations to facilitate and accelerate translational research projects locally, regionally, and nationally.</li><li>Create, provide, and disseminate innovative research programs and partnerships across institutions and communities to address health disparities and deliver the benefits of translational science to all.</li><li>Create and implement scientific and operational innovations that increase the quality, safety, efficiency, effectiveness, and informativeness of clinical research.</li><li>Provide a national resource for the rapid response to urgent public health needs.</li><li>Create, provide, and disseminate CTS training programs for clinical research professionals of all disciplines on the research team.</li><li>Create, provide, and disseminate CTS training and career support programs for translational scientists.</li><li>Foster the development of the emerging field of translational science.</li></ol><h4><strong>Program Goal and Scope</strong></h4><p>The CTSA Collaborative and Innovative Acceleration Award (CCIA) aims to accelerate the pace of translational research by supporting the collaborative development, dissemination, and sustainable implementation of innovative solutions across the CTSA Program Consortium and beyond.

This funding mechanism involves two phases. Both phases are required in the application. Delineation of scientific and/or operational milestones is a key characteristic of this NOFO. Each application must provide a fully developed research plan and budget for both UG3 and UH3 phases at the time of submission, with distinct Aims for each phase.</p><p><i><strong>The UG3 Phase:</strong></i></p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">The UG3 Phase will support the development, adaptation, and/or demonstration of an innovative solution that accelerates the translational research process. A <strong>feasibility assessment should be conducted in the UG3 Phase</strong> to ensure that an innovative solution can be successfully disseminated and implemented during the UH3 Phase of the award.</p><p><i><strong>The UH3 Phase:</strong></i></p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">The <strong>UH3 Phase will support the dissemination, implementation, and evaluation of the innovative solution&nbsp;</strong>that was<strong>&nbsp;</strong>developed during the UG3 Phase by all collaborating organizations for dissemination across multiple CTSA hubs and/or other stakeholders outside the Consortium.</p><p><i><strong>Transition from the UG3 to the UH3 Phase:</strong></i></p><p style="margin-left:.3in;">Milestones provide quantifiable measures of success and are a key characteristic for this bi-phasic mechanism. A milestone is defined as a finding or set of findings that signal the achievement of a Specific Aim in your research plan. Milestones should be comprised of three basic components: (1) a desired goal, (2) a timeline or decision point by which the goal must be accomplished, and (3) evidence that the goal has been accomplished based upon quantitative criteria. For evaluative purposes, each application must include a Milestone Plan as a separate attachment (see Other Attachments below). The Milestone plan should include three separate components:</p><ol><li>A distinct set of <i><strong><u>annual milestones</u></strong></i> for both the UG3 and UH3 Phases related to assessing progress on each Aim of your project.&nbsp;</li><li>A set of <i><strong><u>quantitative, transitional milestones</u></strong></i> that will be used to evaluate overall progress made during the UG3 phase of the award and justify the transition into the UH3 phase of the award (i.e., go/no go criteria), and</li><li>A <strong>Timetable</strong> (e.g., Gantt Chart) identifying when each of the key milestones will be met. The timeline of UG3 activities should not extend into the UH3 Phase of the award as each Phase of the award should contain a distinct project.</li></ol><p style="margin-left:.3in;">In the event of an award, NCATS staff will work the PI(s)/PD(s) to negotiate any changes to the <i><strong>annual milestones</strong></i> each year based on progress. Final negotiated milestones will be included in the Notice of Award.</p><p style="margin-left:.3in;">At the end of the UG3 Phase, NCATS will conduct an administrative review of projects at the end of the UG3 phase to determine the readiness to transition into the UH3 phase. An evaluation will be made based upon successful <i><strong>completion of quantitative transitional milestones (go/no-go criteria)</strong></i> and availability of funds. Award recipients should note that UG3 funding does not guarantee subsequent UH3 funding.</p><p style="margin-left:.3in;"><strong>Applications submitted without a Milestone Plan will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed.</strong></p><p><i><strong>UG3/UH3 Project Period</strong></i></p><p style="margin-left:25px;">The total project period for the UG3/UH3 Cooperative Agreement mechanism cannot exceed 5 years. Flexibility is allowed for the UG3 Phase (1 - 3 years) and the UH3 Phase (2 - 4 years). Examples include:</p><ul><li>UG3/UH3 (up to 5 years): UG3 (1 year) / UH3 (4 years)</li><li>UG3/UH3 (up to 5 years): UG3 (2 years) / UH3 (3 years)</li><li>UG3/UH3 (up to 5 years): UG3 (3 years) / UH3 (2 years)</li></ul><p style="margin-left:25px;">UG3 Phase and UH3 Phase will generally not be awarded in the same NIH fiscal year. For example, applications proposing partial years are not allowed (e.g., UG3 - 1.5 years / UH3 - 3.5 years).</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><i><strong>Pre-Application Consultation:</strong></i></p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Potential applicants are highly encouraged to contact the NCATS Scientific/Research Contacts listed in this NOFO to discuss the scope of the project, required materials, responsiveness, and clinical trials status designation prior to submission of an application.

Milestones provide quantifiable measures of success and are a key characteristic of this bi-phasic UG3/UH3 mechanism. A milestone is defined as a finding or set of findings that signal the achievement of a Specific Aim in your research plan. Milestones should be composed of three basic components: (1) a desired goal, (2) a timeline or decision point by which the goal must be accomplished, and (3) evidence that the goal has been accomplished based upon quantitative criteria. The Milestone plan should include three key components:</p><p style="margin-left:75px;">a) A distinct set of <i><strong>annual milestones</strong></i> for both the UG3 and UH3 Phases related to assessing progress on each Aim of your project.</p><p style="margin-left:75px;">b) A set of <i><strong>quantitative, transitional milestones</strong></i> that will be used to evaluate overall progress made during the UG3 phase of the award and justify the transition into the UH3 phase of the award (i.e., justifiable go/no go criteria).</p><p style="margin-left:75px;">c) A <i><strong>timetable</strong></i> (e.g., Gantt Chart) identifying when each of the key milestones will be met. The timeline of UG3 activities should not extend into the UH3 Phase of the award as each Phase of the award should contain a distinct project.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">In the event of an award, NCATS staff will work the PI(s)/PD(s) to negotiate any changes to the <i><strong>annual milestones</strong></i> each year based on progress. Final negotiated milestones will be included in the Notice of Award.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">NCATS will conduct an administrative review of projects at the end of the UG3 phase to determine the readiness to transition into the UH3 phase. An evaluation will be made based upon successful completion of <i><strong>quantitative transitional milestones (go/no go criteria)</strong></i> and availability of funds. Award recipients should note that UG3 funding does not guarantee subsequent UH3 funding.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>2. Sustainability Plan (use filename &#147;Sustainability Plan&#148;, limited to 3 pages)</strong>:</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">The CCIA awards are not renewable. As such, a sustainability plan is a key component of a CCIA project and should be an extension of the research strategy. The application must include an attachment titled &#147;Sustainability Plan&#148; that outlines a plan to broadly disseminate and sustainably implement the innovative solution across additional CTSA hubs and/or external stakeholders beyond the UG3/UH3 grant periods. The Sustainability Plan should include at least three components including a plan for:</p><p style="margin-left:50px;">a)<strong> Collaborations.</strong> A plan for establishing collaborations with additional CTSA hubs and/or external stakeholders, including for example, federal agencies, local government, industry, small businesses, non-profits organizations, higher education institutions, advocacy groups, health care providers and health care systems, research participants, communities and patients, as appropriate.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;">b)<strong> Financial sustainability.</strong> A plan for creating or obtaining additional external resources for the sustainable implementation of innovative solutions.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;">c)<strong> Sustainable implementation.</strong> A plan for the sustainable adoption and consistent implementation of innovative solutions to reach the intended individual users and/or communities. This could include elements such as presentations, meetings, training programs, websites, consultative services, open-source resources, etc.</p><p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>3. Signed Eligibility Statement&nbsp;(use filename &#147;Eligibility Statement&#148;, limited to 1 page)</strong></p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Each application must include at least one PD/PI or co-Investigator with expertise in translational science to collaborate with the project investigators in developing, adapting, demonstrating, disseminating, implementing, and evaluating innovative solutions to accelerate the translational research process. Translational science expertise is defined as having at least one year of affiliation in a CTSA program role such as an investigator directly supported by a currently active CTSA Hub UL1, UM1, or RC2 program as of the due date of the application as well as alumni from a currently active CTSA Hub KL2/K12, TL1/T32 or Diversity and Re-entry program as of the due date of the application. Current&nbsp;trainees and scholars affiliated with CTSA Hub KL2/K12 and TL1/T32 programs as well as current trainees and alumni from the short-term CTSA Hub TL1 and R25 programs will <u>not</u> be considered to have translational science expertise.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Applications must include an Eligibility Statement signed by the CTSA affiliated program contact PD/PI that provides a description of the translational science expertise and&nbsp;outline the role and period of affiliation on the applicable CTSA&nbsp;hub program.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;"><u>Exception:</u> An Eligibility Statement is <strong><u>not</u></strong> required if the application includes a PD(s)/PI(s) or Co-Investigator who currently serves or has previously served as the PD/PI or MPI of CTSA hub UL1/ UM1, KL2/K12 or TL1/T32 award.</p><p><strong>Applications submitted without a Milestone Plan, Sustainability Plan, and signed Eligibility Statement will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed.</strong></p><p><strong>Applications using these attachments to circumvent the NIH standard page limits as described in the general application guide instructions, will be considered&nbsp;non-compliant and will not be reviewed.</strong></p>

Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and NIH as defined below.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">The PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for:</p><ul><li>Defining research objectives and approaches, planning, conducting, analyzing, and publishing results, interpretations, and conclusions of their studies, and providing overall scientific and administrative leadership for the Research Project.</li><li>Overseeing all aspects of the organization and execution of the studies outlined in the application and approved by NCATS after peer review.</li><li>Negotiate and agree on a final set of milestones, the final negotiated and approved milestones will be specified in&nbsp;the Notice of Award.</li><li>Participating in regular (monthly) conference calls with the NIH Project Collaborator.</li><li>Putting all study materials and procedure manuals into the public domain.

NCATS staff may use information obtained from the data for the preparation of internal reports on the activities of the study. However, recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to all data developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with HHS, PHS, and NIH policies.</li><li>Serve as a resource to provide scientific/programmatic support during the accomplishment of the research by participating in the design of the activities, advising in the selection of sources or resources (e.g., determining where a particular reagent can be found), provision of research resources and reagents available from NCATS&nbsp;award recipients and contractors, or other CTSA Program sites, advising in management and technical performance or participating in the preparation of publications.</li><li>If the award involves a clinical study, oversee the adequacy of adverse event management and reporting, and have regular communications with the PD/PI and study team, which may include attendance at the DSMB and related committee meetings. Review and monitor the progress of inclusion of women and minorities in the clinical trial.</li><li>Review the progress of each participating organization, through consideration of the annual reports, site visits, screening logs, etc.</li><li>Determine whether milestones are appropriate for each stage of the award. Review and approve any milestone changes.</li><li>Monitor study progress; as with any award, continuation, even during the period recommended for support, is contingent upon satisfactory progress. The schedule for these interim reviews will be based on the duration of the award. Continuation of funding will be dependent upon the recipient&#146;s ability to show adequate progress.</li><li>Be responsible for assessing the progress of the project towards the specified milestones, and for recommending if further funds should be released to the project and whether the project should transition to the UH3 Phase.</li><li>Determine continued funding based on the overall robustness of the entire data that adequately allows an interpretation of the results (regardless of being captured in the milestones), overall progress, NIH portfolio balance, and program priorities, competitive landscape, and availability of funds.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;">Additionally, the Project Collaborator, acting as the NIH Program Official, will be responsible for normal stewardship of the award and will be named in the notice of award.&nbsp;The Project Collaborator may recommend the termination or curtailment of an investigator or project/program (or an individual award) in the event the partnerships fail to evolve within the intent and purpose of this program.&nbsp;</p><p>Areas of Joint Responsibility include:</p><ul><li>Clarifying and negotiating any modifications of the annual milestones and timeline.</li><li>Coordination of meetings, if needed, at critical transition points of the award.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;">Dispute Resolution:</p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and HHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.</p>
