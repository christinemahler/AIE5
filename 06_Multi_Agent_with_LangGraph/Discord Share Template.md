2. Good prompting strategies apply most especially to the supervisor nodes as well.
3. Helper functions are helpful. This seems an obvious one, but when you're going to use the same code over and over again, these significantly reduce the amount of effort involved.
4. BONUS: Docstrings are also incredibly important for tool calling unless you have a really intuitive LLM or else explicitly indicate a tool you'd like your agent to use.
